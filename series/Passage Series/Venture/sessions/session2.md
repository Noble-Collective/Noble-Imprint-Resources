# Session 1

## Session 1 Introduction

In the Name of the Lord
Fighting the Lord’s Battles

### Overview

> Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, who rely on horses, who trust in their abundance of chariots and in their multitude of horsemen. They do not look to the Holy One of Israel; they do not seek the Lord. Isaiah 31:1

> Such as are born of God, are steeled with courage for his truth; they are like the rock, which no waves can break; like the adamant, which no sword can cut. Thomas Watson, The Ten Commandments

During this first session, you will consider what it means to embrace a life of courage and bold faith. Many times we think of courage and boldness as a mark only for a special class of heroes. When it comes to the faith, we often reserve such characteristics for a select few. Despite these common conceptions, God calls all of his followers to a life of courage. Believers will encounter difficulty, danger, and opposition that seems impossible to overcome. Sometimes we will be in life or death situations. Other times we will be confronted with a situation with enormous risk. The life of courage is not for a special canon of elite saints. Instead, Christian courage is the common lot for all normal believers. Neither our personal inability nor the immensity of the enemy need cripple us to cowardice and fear. We go forward in faith that when we advance according to God’s name, we go forward with his strength.

### Key Idea

In the face of opposition, I will be courageous.

## Community Study

### Community Confession

_As you open this session, restate this summary statement as a community._

By God’s grace and through faith in Christ, I will no longer walk in fear. **In the face of opposition, I will be courageous.** In the face of rejection, I will live in obedience. In the face of compromise, I will walk in integrity. In the face of insecurity, I will put on valor. In the face of persecution, I will embrace sacrifice. In the face of sin, I will resist temptation. I will count the cost and take up my cross daily. For God’s glory, for our good, and for the sake of the world! Amen and amen!

### Corporate Song

_Sing to the Lord, joining your hearts together in a spirit of praise and worship._

#### A Mighty Fortress Is Our God

##### Verse 1

A mighty fortress is our God, a bulwark never failing;
Our helper he, amid the flood of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe does seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great, and armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

##### Verse 2

Did we in our own strength confide, our striving would be losing,
Were not the right Man on our side, the Man of God's own choosing.
You ask who that may be? Christ Jesus, it is he;
Lord Sabaoth his name, from age to age the same;
And he must win the battle.

##### Verse 3

And though this world, with devils filled, should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God has willed his truth to triumph through us.
The prince of darkness grim, we tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure, for lo! his doom is sure;
One little word shall fell him.

##### Verse 4

That Word above all earthly powers no thanks to them abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours through him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go, this mortal life also;
The body they may kill: God's truth abideth still;
His kingdom is forever!

### Brief Overview

_Use this introduction to preview the session._

> Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God. Psalm 20:7

> No man safely rejoices but he who has the testimony of a good conscience within himself. The boldness of the Saints was always full of the fear of God. Nor were they the less earnest and humble in themselves, because they shone forth with great virtues and grace. But the boldness of wicked men springs from pride and presumption, and at the last turns to their own confusion. Thomas à Kempis, The Imitation of Christ

There is a great tendency to measure our potential success by our own inner strength. When we feel fit for a task, we tend to be confident and calm. When we face a challenge beyond our ability, we can become unsure and afraid. Too easily we rely upon our own abilities and resources. This is a recipe for disaster, defeat, and despair. God will often confront us with challenges that exceed our capacity. Sometimes these challenges will seem insurmountable, gigantic, and deadly. Believers are rescued from eternal punishment by God’s gracious and unparalleled might. After experiencing God’s salvation, believers continue to walk each day in the name of the Lord and in the strength of his power. To rely upon ourselves in the face of earthly challenges and deadly enemies is a fool’s errand. Left to our own strength, confidence will wax and wane based on our daily status and the size of the challenge. Armed by God’s unchanging and superlative power, we need fear no enemy, no foe, no adversary, or no deadly threat. If we walk in God’s name, we go forward in God’s might.

### Opening Prayer

_Spend time praying, dedicating your community and these next moments to the Lord. Use this time of prayer to focus your minds, prepare your hearts, and ready your wills to seek and serve God together._

Almighty Lord, we give you all praise and all honor. You are a shelter to your people in the face of difficulty. You are a fortress for our defense in the midst of conflict. You are a sure bulwark that guards us from deadly foes. You are our victory, confidence, and trust. The enemies that surround cannot contend with your power. The opponents who slander will have their shame come upon their own heads. Help us live in the fierce and ferocious world with courage, boldness, and faith. May we not see strength in our flesh. Instead, may we bask in your mighty and powerful name. Help us, O God, we pray! Amen!

### Faith Foundation

_Read the following biblical proverb and discuss the question below as a community. Record thoughts from the discussion in the space below._

#### Biblical Wisdom

A horse is prepared for the day of battle, but victory is of the Lord. Proverbs 21:31

#### Core Principle

Christians face risk with courage and confidence in God’s victory. Many times, life can feel like a battle. Sometimes believers will find themselves in war zones. Other times, the difficulties and dangers of life will seem like an armed conflict. It is important for believers to be ready “for the day of battle.” In war, there are deadly dangers, cruel enemies, and potential for great fear. In the face of war and fearsome foes, humans make preparations. In anticipation of danger, “a horse is prepared” in which people get together all of the resources needed to fight and win the conflict. People assemble armies, arm soldiers, organize regiments, and plan strategy. Although there is wisdom in making prudent preparations, no human weaponry can secure real victory. The battles and conflicts of life are only won by the Lord: “victory is of the Lord.” Christians approach the life of faith like a bold and faithful soldier. Faithful soldiers do not cower in fear because they put their full trust in the Lord’s victory. Those who rely upon human strength and resources will cower and retreat in the face of danger and conflict. Those armed with confidence and trust in the Lord can express courage in the face of great danger.

### Biblical Exploration

#### Scriptural Narrative

_Read the following biblical text together as a community._

> 17:1 Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war at Socoh in Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah in Ephes-dammim. 2 Saul and the men of Israel assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah, arraying themselves for battle against the Philistines. 3 The Philistines stood on one hill and the Israelites stood on another, with the valley between them. 4 Then a champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out from the Philistine camp. He was six cubits and a span in height, 5 and he had a bronze helmet on his head. He wore a bronze coat of mail weighing five thousand shekels, 6 and he had armor of bronze on his legs and a javelin of bronze slung between his shoulders. 7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. In addition, his shield bearer went before him. 8 And Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and array yourselves for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not servants of Saul? Choose one of your men and have him come down against me. 9 If he is able to fight me and kill me, then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and labor for us.” 10 Then the Philistine said, “I defy the ranks of Israel this day! Give me a man to fight!” 11 On hearing the words of the Philistine, Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and greatly afraid. 12 Now David was the son of a man named Jesse, an Ephrathite from Bethlehem of Judah who had eight sons in the days of Saul. And Jesse was old and well along in years. 13 The three older sons of Jesse had followed Saul into battle: The firstborn was Eliab, the second was Abinadab, and the third was Shammah. 14 And David was the youngest. The three oldest had followed Saul, 15 but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s sheep in Bethlehem. 16 For forty days the Philistine came forward every morning and evening to take his stand. 17 One day Jesse said to his son David, “Take this ephah of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread for your brothers and hurry to their camp. 18 Take also these ten portions of cheese to the commander of their unit. Check on the welfare of your brothers and bring back an assurance from them. 19 They are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.” 20 So David got up early in the morning, left the flock with a keeper, loaded up, and set out as Jesse had instructed him. He reached the camp as the army was marching out to its position and shouting the battle cry. 21 And Israel and the Philistines arrayed in formation against each other. 22 Then David left his supplies in the care of the quartermaster and ran to the battle line. When he arrived, he asked his brothers how they were doing. 23 And as he was speaking with them, suddenly the champion named Goliath, the Philistine from Gath, came forward from the Philistines and shouted his usual words, which David also heard. 24 When all the men of Israel saw Goliath, they fled from him in great fear. 25 Now the men of Israel had been saying, “Do you see this man who keeps coming out to defy Israel? To the man who kills him the king will give great riches. And he will give him his daughter in marriage and exempt his father’s house from taxation in Israel.” 26 David asked the men who were standing with him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes this disgrace from Israel? Just who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God?” 27 The people told him about the offer, saying, “That is what will be done for the man who kills him.” 28 Now when David’s oldest brother Eliab heard him speaking to the men, his anger burned against David. “Why have you come down here?” he asked. “And with whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride and wickedness of heart—you have come down to see the battle!” 29 “What have I done now?” said David. “Was it not just a question?” 30 Then he turned from him toward another and asked about the offer, and those people answered him just as the first ones had answered. 31 Now David’s words were overheard and reported to Saul, who called for him. 32 And David said to Saul, “Let no man’s heart fail on account of this Philistine. Your servant will go and fight him!” 33 But Saul replied, “You cannot go out against this Philistine to fight him. You are just a boy, and he has been a warrior from his youth.” 34 David replied, “Your servant has been tending his father’s sheep, and whenever a lion or a bear came and carried off a lamb from the flock, 35 I went after it, struck it down, and delivered the lamb from its mouth. If it reared up against me, I would grab it by its fur, strike it down, and kill it. 36 Your servant has killed lions and bears; this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of the living God.” 37 David added, “The Lord, who delivered me from the claws of the lion and the bear, will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine.” “Go,” said Saul, “and may the Lord be with you.” 38 Then Saul clothed David in his own tunic, put a bronze helmet on his head, and dressed him in armor. 39 David strapped his sword over the tunic and tried to walk, but he was not accustomed to them. “I cannot walk in these,” David said to Saul. “I am not accustomed to them.” So David took them off. 40 And David took his staff in his hand, selected five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in the pouch of his shepherd’s bag. And with his sling in hand, he approached the Philistine. 41 Now the Philistine came closer and closer to David, with his shield-bearer before him. 42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he despised him because he was just a boy, ruddy and handsome. 43 “Am I a dog,” he said to David, “that you come at me with sticks?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 44 “Come here,” he called to David, “and I will give your flesh to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field!” 45 But David said to the Philistine, “You come against me with sword and spear and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. 46 This day the Lord will deliver you into my hand. This day I will strike you down, cut off your head, and give the carcasses of the Philistines to the birds of the air and the creatures of the earth. Then the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel. 47 And all those assembled here will know that it is not by sword or spear that the Lord saves; for the battle is the Lord’s, and He will give all of you into our hands.” 48 As the Philistine started forward to attack him, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet him. 49 Then David reached into his bag, took out a stone, and slung it, striking the Philistine on the forehead. The stone sank into his forehead, and he fell facedown on the ground. 50 Thus David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand he struck down the Philistine and killed him. 51 David ran and stood over him. He grabbed the Philistine’s sword and pulled it from its sheath and killed him; and he cut off his head with the sword. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they turned and ran. 52 Then the men of Israel and Judah charged forward with a shout and pursued the Philistines to the entrance of Gath and to the gates of Ekron. And the bodies of the Philistines were strewn along the Shaaraim road to Gath and Ekron. 53 When the Israelites returned from their pursuit of the Philistines, they plundered their camps. 54 David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, and he put Goliath’s weapons in his own tent. 55 As Saul had watched David going out to confront the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?” “As surely as you live, O king,” Abner replied, “I do not know.” 56 “Find out whose son this young man is!” said the king. 57 So when David returned from killing the Philistine, still holding his head in his hand, Abner took him and brought him before Saul. 58 “Whose son are you, young man?” asked Saul. “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem,” David replied. 1 Samuel 17:1–58

#### Biblical Commentary

_Use this commentary as a way to get oriented to the basic teaching of this biblical text. This explanation will help in the above discussion._

**Introduction.** In life, we will be confronted with many things that will cause fear. Sometimes we will experience challenges that feel impossible to overcome, threats that seem inescapable, and enemies that appear unconquerable. In the face of giant opposition, we can cower in fear and intimidation, or we can foolishly rush into danger in our own human strength. Neither response is wise nor faithful. God calls his people to demonstrate measured and courageous faith in the face of what seems to be insurmountable opposition. Christians do not approach danger in their own strength. Neither do they shrink away from the field of battle. Surrounded and confronted by fierce enemies, Christians move forward in the name of the Lord and armed by his empowering presence.

<!-- 1 Samuel -->

Enemies, War, and Fear. At the time of this story, the Israelites faced fierce and dangerous enemies. Israel and the Philistines gathered their armies for battle on opposing sides (17:1–2, 21) with “the valley between them” (17:3). On the side of the Philistines was a giant called Goliath. He stood “six cubits and a span in height” (17:4; about 9 feet 9 inches) and was heavily armored (17:5–6) and armed (17:6–7). As “a champion” (17:4; cf. 17:23, 51), Goliath was a warrior fit for battle. Confidence in his own strength, Goliath made belittling taunts (17:8), issued challenging threats (17:8–10), and exclaimed brazen defiance (17:10, 25–26, 45) against Israel. He did this for forty days and “came forward every morning and evening to take his stand” (17:16; cf. 17:23). Goliath’s opposition and defiance continued when David volunteered to fight him. Goliath “despised [David] because he was just a boy” (17:42). Goliath mocked David, saying he was coming at him like a person confronts a dog with sticks (17:43). Goliath “cursed David by his gods” (17:43). The gathered Philistines and jeering Goliath caused Israel to fall into despair and fear: “Saul and all the Israelites were dismayed and greatly afraid” (17:11; cf. 17:24). At the sight of Goliath, “all the men of Israel … fled from him in great fear” (17:24).

David’s faith in God allowed him to risk his life to serve God. He faced many obstacles. David not only faced the Philistines and Goliath, but the anger of his brothers (17:28–29), an anger that suggested previous tension in their relationship (17:30). They were upset with him and accused him of dishonorable motives such as “pride and wickedness of heart” (17:28). He also faced the skepticism from Saul, saying he was only a boy (17:33). His fearless faith in God allowed him to summon the rest of Israel to fearlessness (17:32). In the face of death, mockery, blasphemy, skepticism, anger, accusation, and a number of other challenges, David and God’s people would gain surprising victory.

**Unexpected Victory/Counterintuitive.** God brings victory in unexpected ways. David was an unlikely choice to fight against Goliath. He was the youngest of Jesse’s eight sons (17:12–14, 55–58). David was a shepherd (17:15, 28, 34–35), not a warrior like three of his brothers who followed Saul into battle (17:13–15, 19). His father sent him on a mission to deliver food supplies and check on the condition of his brothers (17:17–19, 22), and David ended up being the only one willing to fight the giant Goliath (17:25–37). The youth and inexperience of David were contrasted to Goliath’s long experience in war (17:33). His role as a mere messenger soon turned into him being one of Israel’s mightiest heroes. David refused Saul’s tunic, helmet, and armor because he was not accustomed to them (17:38–39). Instead, David went with his staff, gathered five smooth stones, and his sling (17:40) to the approaching Philistine (17:41, 48). Ultimately, David did gain victory over Goliath (17:48–51, 54) and the Philistines (17:51–53, 57). David defeated the Philistine “with a sling and a stone; without a sword in his hand” (17:50).

**Godliness.** In the midst of difficult circumstances, David demonstrated great faith, character, and godliness. In respect and submission, David honored his father and obeyed his instructions (17:20, 22). Rather than seeking his own safety, he rushed to the battle line (17:22). Possessing a heart of piety and devotion to God, David rejected Goliath’s taunts: “who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God” (17:26). In a display of fearlessness, David told Saul to “let no man’s heart fail” (17:32). Bold and courageous, David said that he would “go and fight” Goliath (17:32). Desperate for a victory, Saul had promised wealth, a wife, and freedom from taxation for any who would defeat Goliath (17:25–27, 30). David inquired about this, but fought Goliath to deliver Israel from its enemies and vindicate God’s reputation. David arrived in the midst of battle formation (17:20–21) and Goliath’s taunts (17:23). David’s God-centered faith made him fit for the battle.

**Faith.** Despite concerns over David’s youth and inexperience, David replied that he was fit for the job. In the past, to defend his father’s flock, David struck down lions and bears (17:34–37). David “delivered the lamb from [a bear’s mouth]” (17:35), God “delivered [him] from the claws of the lion and the bear” (17:37), David had hope that God would “deliver [him] from the hand of this Philistine” (17:37), and David was confident that God would “deliver [Goliath] into [his] hand” (17:46). His past experience of God’s deliverance fueled his faith in God’s future deliverance, giving him courage to face the blasphemous and towering Goliath with courage and confidence. David went with Saul’s blessing of God’s presence—“may the Lord be with you” (17:37). It is by faith in God’s presence that David lived out his faith in the midst of danger, risk, and fear. When he approached the Philistine, he was confident that he would defeat him (17:44, 46) and the Philistines (17:47). Goliath’s blasphemous words would result in his own shameful death (17:44, 46).

David’s faith in God eclipsed his fear of Goliath. David did not place his faith in human weapons. He knew that it was “not by sword or spear that the Lord saves” (17:47). Instead, he came against Goliath “in the name of the Lord of Hosts” (17:45). On his side was “the God of the armies of Israel” (17:45). David’s confidence did not come from his own ability, weaponry, or training; his confidence came from the fact that “the battle is the Lord’s” (17:47). Although David inquired about Saul’s promised reward (17:26–31), David was motivated that “the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel” (17:46).

**Conclusion.** In the life of faith, we will face enemies. Sometimes these enemies will seem colossal. The enormity of threats can expose our cowardice and timidity. Or, the gigantic nature of a danger can galvanize our faith in the Lord. David exemplified this latter way of faith and courage. His trust in the Lord and measured boldness are examples to us. We may not fight human giants, but we regularly encounter danger that brings us to the brink of defeat, death, and despair. In these situations, God’s people rise to the occasion—not armed with earthly weapons, but with confidence in the Lord. Christians face risk with confidence that the battle belongs to the Lord.

> Be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged before the king of Assyria and the vast army with him, for there is a greater One with us than with him. With him is only the arm of flesh, but with us is the Lord our God to help us and to fight our battles. 2 Chronicles 32:7–8

> Now I know that the Lord saves His anointed; He answers him from His holy heaven with the saving power of His right hand. Some trust in chariots and others in horses, but we trust in the name of the Lord our God. They collapse and fall, but we rise up and stand firm. Psalm 20:6–7

> You are my King, O God, who ordains victories for Jacob. Through You we repel our foes; through Your name we trample our enemies. For I do not trust in my bow, nor does my sword save me. For You save us from our enemies; You put those who hate us to shame. In God we have boasted all day long, and Your name we will praise forever. Psalm 44:4–8

> Yet I will have compassion on the house of Judah, and I will save them—not by bow or sword or war, not by horses and cavalry, but by the Lord their God. Hosea 1:7

> I have told you these things so that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation. But take courage; I have overcome the world! John 16:33

> What then shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? Romans 8:31
> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? As it is written: “For Your sake we face death all day long; we are considered as sheep to be slaughtered.” No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor principalities, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 8:35–39

> You, little children, are from God and have overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. 1 John 4:4

> Everyone born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world: our faith. Who then overcomes the world? Only he who believes that Jesus is the Son of 1 John 5:4–5

> Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called when you made the good confession before many witnesses.

### Spiritual Practice

_The following activity provides a concrete way to realize your responsibility before God. Set aside enough time to complete this activity in its entirety. Follow each step of this exercise as a guide._

#### Asking God to Hear Our Prayer

_Read the following verse out loud. Then, spend several minutes in silence before the Lord, acknowledging his presence._

> Save me, O God, by Your name, and vindicate me by Your might! Hear my prayer, O God; listen to the words of my mouth Psalm 54:1–2

#### Acknowledging the Safety of God’s Name

_After several minutes of silence, offer this prayer to God. Pray with open hands facing upwards to symbolize you stand before God in complete openness._

> Almighty God, “it is good to praise the Lord, and to sing praises to Your name, O Most High” (Psalm 92:1). In our own name, we are weak. In our own strength, we will fail. In our own power, we crumble and fall. But “the nations will fear the name of the Lord, and all the kings of the earth will fear Your glory” (Psalm 102:15). Therefore, “I will praise You, O Lord my God, with all my heart; I will glorify Your name forever” (Psalm 86:12). Help me to embrace my weakness and boast in your strength. May I not cower in the face of danger, difficulty, or adversary. Grant me courage for each day because “the name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous run to it and are safe” (Proverbs 18:10). Amen.

#### Observing Our Weakness and God’s Strength

_Go outside and find five small stones. Gather them together. Reflect on the story of David killing Goliath. For several minutes, observe the stones and consider how small they are compared to a giant warrior. Think about how you would feel going into battle with five stones and a sling. Specifically, meditate on how these stones represent our smallness and weakness. Remind yourself of how strong and powerful God is, especially to use weak vessels to accomplish his purposes in the world._

> Let them praise the name of the Lord, for His name alone is exalted; His splendor is above the earth and the heavens. He has raised up a horn for His people, the praise of all His saints, of Israel, a people near to Him. Hallelujah! Psalm 148:13–14

<Question id=VentureSes1-GivingPraise-Q1>God, these are reasons you are worthy of praise...</Question>

#### Expressing Hope and Confidence in the Lord

_Conclude your time with the Lord by expressing your trust and confidence in the Lord._

> Blessed be the Lord, who has not given us as prey to their teeth. We have escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowler; the net is torn, and we have slipped away. Our help is in the name of the Lord, the Maker of heaven and earth. Psalm 124:6–8
