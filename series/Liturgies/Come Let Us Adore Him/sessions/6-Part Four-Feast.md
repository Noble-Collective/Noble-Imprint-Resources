# Part Four: Feast

## Feast Liturgy

### INTRODUCTION

#### Festal Welcome

##### LEADER

Welcome to the feast of Epiphany! This gathering is a celebration that commemorates the appearing of God’s Son in the world. In Jesus Christ, God’s light penetrated into the dark world, dispelling darkness, overcoming evil, and announcing salvation to fallen creation. This holy day reenacts good news of great joy—darkness turning to light now that Christ has been made known to the world. This community celebration is designed to be interactive—inviting your participation, encouraging your contribution, and summoning you to faithful response. We hope this celebration captures your imagination and stirs you to wonder as you reflect on the coming and revelation of the Son of God. During this feast, we will read Scripture, sing songs, offer prayers, and enjoy conversation to help us remember and recount this glorious truth: the eternal Son of God took on human flesh and manifest himself as the Savior of the world.

### EPIPHANY PREAMBLE

#### After Darkness, Light

##### LEADER

After the long night of sin and curse, light has come into the world. The Epiphany season is a time to remember the revelation of God’s Son to humanity. Jesus is the Light of the World, God’s eternal Son who took on human flesh, triumphing over darkness, overcoming evil, and conquering sin. This evening, we remember that Jesus was born Savior of the world. Since God’s light has dawned on humanity, this is a time of searching, seeing, beholding, and testifying. After prolonged darkness, divine light has come.

As we gather tonight, we imitate the wise men, who long ago sought for the baby born in Bethlehem. Today, we search for the one and only Christ. We heed these noble travelers as our guides, who journeyed afar by the light of the celestial star. Today, we learn again to see by the light of God’s own Son. During this assembly, we keep step in step with the Magi who bowed in worship, offered gifts of devotion, and adored the incarnate Lord born in the manger. Today, we behold the glory of God made manifest in human flesh. We follow the example of these eastern sojourners who brought news to Herod that the King of the Jews was born. Today, we bear witness to the world that the Savior has come.

Tonight, we gather in hope that in Christ God has “turned night into day, making light seem near in the face of darkness” (Job 17:12).

#### Community Prayer

##### ALL

God of all light and life, we give you all praise! We gather to celebrate Jesus—God with Us, the Light of the World. Remind us of his glorious appearing. Fix our minds on his miraculous incarnation. Tune our hearts to adore him as Savior and Lord. Shine forth his light throughout the world. Make his light once again shine on us. Amen.

### SEARCHING FOR THE KING OF KINGS

#### Astray from God and Groping in Darkness

##### LEADER

Tonight, we remember that our sin has separated us from God. We have strayed from our Maker. In our sin, we are lost in darkness, straying from righteousness, groping after pleasure, seeking vain idols, and wandering aimlessly in the world.

#### Wretched, Helpless, and Distrest

##### VERSE 1

Wretched, helpless, and distrest,
Ah! whither shall I fly,
Ever gasping after rest,
I cannot find it nigh:
Naked, sick, and poor, and blind,
Fast bound in Sin and Misery,
Friend of Sinners, let me find
My help, my all in Thee.

##### VERSE 2

Who my Misery can relate,
My depth of Woe reveal?

In helpless Adam fell.
Driven out of mine abode,
I now have lost my perfect bliss,
Fallen, fallen out of God,
And banish’d Paradise.

##### VERSE 3

I am all unclean, unclean,
Thy Purity I want;
My whole heart is sick of Sin,

Full of putrifying Sores,
Of Bruises and of Wounds, my Soul
Looks to Jesus, Help implores,
And Gasps to be made whole.

##### VERSE 4

In the Wilderness I stray,
My foolish Heart is blind;
Noting do I know: The Way
Of Peace I cannot find.

And take, O take the Vail away;
Turn my Darkness into Light,
My Midnight into Day.

#### Seeking God’s Light

In our darkness, we seek for God’s light. In our sin, we search for divine mercy. In our groping, we search for redeeming grace. Thanks be to God! We wandered in our lost estate, but our great God has come to us: “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost” (Luke 19:10).

Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, prisoners in affliction and chains, because they rebelled against the words of God and despised the counsel of the Most High. He humbled their hearts with hard labor; they stumbled, and there was no one to help. Psalm 107:10–12

Heav’n sings Hallelujah:
Hallelujah the earth replies.

Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:
Haste, haste to bring Him laud,

Let loving hearts enthrone Him.

#### Making Jesus Known to the World

##### LEADER

As followers of Christ, we are called to bear witness to the light.
God has called us to “proclaim the virtues of Him who called you
out of darkness into His marvelous light” (1 Peter 2:9). We find a
helpful and holy example in John the Baptist.

##### ALL

Like John the Baptist, we have been “sent from God” into the world (John 1:6).

Like John the Baptist, we have come “as a witness to testify about the Light, so that through him everyone might believe” (John 1:7).

Like John the Baptist, we are “not the Light,” but we are sent into the world “to testify about the Light” (John 1:8).

Like John the Baptist, we testify that Jesus is “the true Light who gives light to every man” (John 1:9).

##### LEADER

The church is called to be light in the world. Hear the testimony of God’s word:

I will also make You a light for the nations, to bring My salvation to the ends of the earth. Isaiah 49:6

I am sending you to them to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those sanctified by faith in Me. Acts 26:17–18

For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light, for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth. Ephesians 5:8–9

You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead, they set it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. Matthew 5:14– 16

Be blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and perverse generation, in which you shine as lights in the world. Philippians 2:15

You are all sons of the light and sons of the day; we do not belong to the night or to the darkness. 1 Thessalonians 5:5

Your light will break forth like the dawn, and your healing will come quickly. Your righteousness will go before you, and the glory of the Lord will be your rear guard. Then you will call, and the Lord will answer; you will cry out, and He will say, ‘Here I am.’ If you remove the yoke from your midst, the pointing of the finger and malicious talk, and if you give yourself to the hungry and satisfy the afflicted soul, then your light will go forth in the darkness, and your night will be like noonday. Isaiah 58:8–10

##### LEADER

As we embrace our calling as light in the world, we look forward to the day when believers from all people will be guided by God’s own light.

Arise, shine, for your light has come, and the glory of the Lord rises upon you. For behold, darkness covers the earth, and thick darkness is over the peoples; but the Lord will rise upon you, and His glory will appear over you. Nations will come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your dawn. Isaiah 60:1–3

No longer will the sun be your light by day, nor the brightness of the moon shine on your night; for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your splendor. Your sun will no longer set, and your moon will not wane; for the Lord will be your everlasting light, and the days of your sorrow will cease. Isaiah 60:19–20

#### Send the Light

#### READER

There’s a call comes ringing o’er the restless wave:
“Send the light! Send the light!”
There are souls to rescue, there are souls to save.

Let it shine from shore to shore.
Send the light, the blessed Gospel light.
Let it shine forevermore.
