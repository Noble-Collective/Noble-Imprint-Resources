## Resources Overview

> How precious is Your loving devotion, O God, that the children of men take refuge in the shadow of Your wings! They feast on the abundance of Your house, and You give them drink from Your river of delights. For with You is the fountain of life; in Your light we see light. 

<< Psalm 36:7–9

> Feast, Christians, feast; you have a right to feast. Go to the house of feasting to-morrow, celebrate your Saviour’s birth; do not be ashamed to be glad, you have a right to be happy. Recollect that your Master ate butter and honey. Go your way, rejoice to-morrow; but, in your feasting, think of the Man in Bethlehem; let him have a place in your hearts, give him the glory, think of the virgin who conceived him, but think most of all of the Man born, the Child given. I finish by again saying,—“A Happy Christmas to you all!” 

<< Charles Spurgeon, “The Birth of Christ”

We have come to the end of this liturgical season. But it does not mean the end of our celebration. Christ’s incarnation is foundational to our Christian life, faith, and witness. Therefore, we continue to bask in the blessing of Christ’s birth. We continually celebrate the grace of his coming. We rejoice in his appearing to sinful mankind. We rehearse the narrative that tells the divine in-breaking of God into human history. We cherish the humility of the Son—his perfection incarnate in human flesh. We cling to the refuge that is the God-Man, Christ Jesus. His incarnation makes him a fitting and faithful Savior to sinners. And we raise our voices to announce his coming to the world. In the following pages, you will find resources and information to help you continue your study of Christ’s incarnation. May they nourish you in the days ahead as you have been nourished during these past weeks. Although the festive season passes (until another year), may your heart continue to relish Christ’s incarnating work—his humble and lowly coming—with an unbroken festal shout of joy!
