# The Liturgy

## Prelude

As you gather for the feast, take time to quiet your heart, still your mind, and focus your attention. Tonight we will remember the rejection, suffering, and crucifixion of Christ. You can pray this prayer to help you prepare for the
evening together.

> Gracious God, Thank you for your Son and his sacrifice on the cross. Jesus is payment for sin. Through faith, may I live in the righteousness of his life. He is the light of world. By believing in his name, may his light dispel all
darkness in me. Jesus is the promised Savior. With full and complete trust, may I learn to surrender my life to Jesus as my Redeemer and Lord. May I humbly receive his love so that I can love God fully and love others truly. Amen!

As others gather at your table, greet them with the following words:

> “Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” (Philippians 1:2)

As you wait for the service to begin, reflect on this passage of the Bible:

> “For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should follow in His footsteps: ‘He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in His mouth.’ When they heaped abuse on Him, He did not retaliate; when He suffered, He made no threats, but entrusted Himself to Him who judges justly. He Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. ‘By His stripes you are healed.’ For ‘you were like sheep going astray,’ but now you have returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.” (1 Peter 2:21–25)

## A First Word: An Invitation to Feast

### “Doxology”: A Gathering Song

#### People

Praise God from Whom all blessings flow.
Praise Him all creatures here below.
Praise Him above ye heav’nly host.
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.

### Greetings

#### Leader

Greetings in the name of Christ! This evening we come to feast. Around this symbolic meal, we gather to remember, to confess, to fellowship, and (even) to celebrate. As pilgrims longing for our permanent residence in “the city of
the living God” (Hebrews 12:22), this feast strengthens us in our present sojourn as we trek together toward our future homeland. Tonight, the cross is at the center of our gathering, as it is ever at the center of our faith. The cross
—that object which represents suffering, judgment, and death—is God’s divine instrument for salvation, forgiveness, and mercy. This evening, we invite you to listen, look, eat, sing, and pray—to engage your whole being—so that your faith will be nourished. As we will see, God really can “prepare a table in the wilderness” (Psalm 78:19). In fact, God can transform a wilderness feast into a banquet of joy and hope. Let us pray!


### Prayer for Help

##### Leader

God of mercy and grace. We gather tonight to remember your love toward us in Christ. No greater love has there been than when you “[proved your] love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Romans 5:8). But, we confess, our memories grow weak in this earthly wilderness. Our ears are often too dull to heed your word. Our eyes are too weak to see your works. Our appetites draw us away from that which satisfies. Our minds are easily shackled with falsehood. Our feet are prone to wander in sin. Our hearts are enticed by shallow loves Today, as all days, we need your mercy and grace and love. This night, may our encounter with your love help us to “love the Lord [our] God with all [our] heart and with all [our] soul and with all [our] strength and with all [our] mind” (Luke 10:27). Amen!

## Feasting in Lament: Grieving the Burden and Bondage of Sin

### Cup of Bitterness

*Hold up the cup.*

##### Leader

Please pour the drink into your cup.

Tonight, we remember and grieve the bitterness of sin. We drink this bitter
cup to symbolically remember the burden of sin, grieve the pain of
disobedience, and lament the presence of darkness in God’s world. Let us
drink together!

*Drink the cup.*

*Point (or hold up) to the unlit candle.*

### Light and Darkness

#### Leader

The unlit candle reminds us of the time at the beginning of creation when “the earth was formless and void, and darkness was over the surface of the deep” and “the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters” (Genesis 1:2). Into the vast and shapeless darkness, God spoke light into the world: “God said, ‘Let there be light,’ and there was light” (Genesis 1:3).

*Light the candle.*

##### Leader

When God made the world, all creation was a perfect and flourishing paradise. All creation was guided by the light of God’s presence. All creation basked in God’s goodness. This paradise, however, did not last. Through pride and evil desire, the first humans, Adam and Eve, rebelled against God and infected God’s good world with sin. The world was in darkness, and humans were exiled from the light of God’s presence. Created noble in God’s image, humans were now sentenced to a life burdened with sin, shrouded with shame, shackled in fear, and destined for judgment. The darkness of sin and the gloom of evil had invaded God’s good world.

*Blow out the candle.*

### The Egg and Our Sinful Condition

*Hold up the egg.*

#### Leader

This egg represents the beginning of life. With this symbol, we remember the creation of the world and the fall of humanity. In fact, we remember that we ourselves are guilty in Adam and born in sin. This evening, we gather to lament—to mourn evil in the world, to groan the loss of paradise, to protest the rule of darkness, and to grieve our own sinful condition. Outside of Christ, each of us lives in an exile of guilt, shame, and fear. Left to ourselves, we stand guilty before a holy God! 

Take the egg from your plate. Let us eat in remembrance that we were born in
sin.

*Eat the egg.*


#### People

“Truly, truly, I tell you, everyone who sins is a slave to sin.” (John 8:34)

#### Leader

“Just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, so also death was passed on to all men, because all sinned.” (Romans 5:12)

#### People

O God, we cry out to you in our sinful exile! Help us, O God!

##### Leader

“Surely I was brought forth in iniquity; I was sinful when my mother conceived me.” (Psalm 51:5)

#### People

O God, we cry out to you in our sinful exile! Help us, O God!

#### Leader

“The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it? I, the Lord, search the heart; I examine the mind to reward a man according to his way, by what his deeds deserve.” (Jeremiah 17:9–10)

#### People

O God, we cry out to you in our sinful exile! Help us, O God!

#### Leader

“But your iniquities have built barriers between you and your God, and your sins have hidden His face from you, so that He does not hear. For your hands are stained with blood, and your fingers with iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue mutters injustice.” (Isaiah 59:2–3)

#### People

O God, we cry out to you in our sinful exile! Help us, O God!

### Catechism Questions

#### Leader

What ruined God’s good creation?

#### Children

Sin.

#### Leader

What is sin?

#### Children

Sin is any lack of conformity to God: breaking God’s law, rebelling against
God’s rule, doubting God’s word, and stealing God’s glory.

### Bitter Herbs and the Bitterness of Sin

*Hold up the horseradish.*

#### Leader

The horseradish symbolizes our bondage to sin. Bitter herbs remind us of our bitter lives in sin. With Israel, we lament the harsh and painful slavery of a cruel and evil master. Oppressed by the tyranny of evil, we are born slaves to sin and exiles from paradise. With Paul, we grieve that we “were dead in [our] trespasses and sins, in which [we] used to walk,” subject to “the ways of this world and of the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit who is now at work in the sons of disobedience” (Ephesians 2:1–2). But, with Job, “[we] will not restrain [our] mouth; [we] will speak in the anguish of [our] spirit; [we] will complain in the bitterness of [our] soul” (Job 7:11).

Take a small spoonful of horseradish and place it on your matzah. Let us eat together to remember the bitterness of sin and to long for better days to come.

*Eat the horseradish and matzah.*

#### Leader

“For my iniquities have overwhelmed me; they are a burden too heavy to bear.” (Psalm 38:4)

“I am bent and brought low; all day long I go about mourning.” (Psalm 38:6)

“For my loins are full of burning pain, and no soundness remains in my body. I am numb and badly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.” (Psalm 38:7–8)

“My heart pounds, my strength fails, and even the light of my eyes has faded. My beloved and friends shun my disease, and my kinsmen stand at a distance.” (Psalm 38:10–11)

“Many are my enemies without cause, and many hate me without reason.” (Psalm 38:19)

#### People

“Out of the depths [we] cry to You, O Lord! O Lord, hear [our] voice; let Your ears be attentive to [our] plea for mercy.” (Psalm 130:1)

#### Leader

“So we called out to the Lord, the God of our fathers; and the Lord heard our voice and saw our affliction, toil, and oppression.” (Deuteronomy 26:7)

#### People

Blessed are you, our God, Creator of the universe. All that you made was very good. But, the first man ate wrongly, loving the food more than the Giver of food. All creation was struck and groaned. We have been struck and we groan. Great giver of all good things we taste the bitterness and long for something greater. Amen.

### “Psalm 3”: A Lament Song

#### People

##### Verse 1
How many are my foes?
They rise up like the sea.
Reputation in the dust,
No salvation for me.

##### Chorus
But you are my shield—
My glory, shine around.
Lift up your head.
Answer me
As I cry to you

##### Verse 2
I lay down and sleep.
In the morning you woke me.
I will not fear
Though a thousand form against me.

##### Chorus
But you are my shield—
My glory, shine around.
Lift up your head.
Answer me
As I cry to you.

##### Bridge
Get up Lord! Save my soul!
Get up Lord! Strike your blow!
Get up Lord! Let them know!
Salvation is yours!

## Feasting in Confession: Acknowledging Our Guilt and Shame

### Cup of Confession

*Hold up the cup.*

#### Leader

Once again, please pour the drink into your cup.

Tonight, we offer ourselves to God in full disclosure. We drink this sour cup to symbolically remember that we deserve the judgment and wrath of God. But, as Christians, we do not “grieve like the rest, who are without hope” (1 Thessalonians 4:13). God hears our pleas for mercy. As we drink, we acknowledge that we are guilty sinners before a holy God who is ready and willing to hear our confession. Let us drink together!

*Drink the cup.*

### Parsley and Our Remorse for Sin

*Hold up the parsley and salt water.*

#### Leader


Tonight, the parsley represents the hope that God offers pardon for sinful people. Parsley’s bitter taste, cleansing scent, and refreshing savor encourage us to seek God to cleanse us from our sin. The salt water represents the tears
of God’s people, suffering in the bondage of evil. We dip the parsley into salt water to represent our own tears, mourning our bondage to sin. More than tears of regret, these tears remind us of the cleansing power of confession to God.

Dip the parsley in the salt water. Take a bite of the sprig of parsley.

*Eat the sprig of parsley.*

#### People

“My eyes overflow unceasingly, without relief, until the Lord looks down from heaven and sees.” (Lamentations 3:49–50)


#### Leader

“Have mercy on me, O God, according to Your loving devotion; according to Your great compassion, blot out my transgressions. Wash me clean of my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Against You, You only, have I sinned and done what is evil in Your sight, so that You may be proved right when You speak and blameless when You judge.” (Psalm 51:1–4)

#### People

“God, have mercy on me, a sinner!” (Luke 18:13)

### Leaven and the Cleansing from Sin

*Hold up the leaven or leavened bread.*

#### Leader

God promises to cleanse sinners who confess their sins in genuine faith and sincere repentance. Leaven, the element that makes bread rise, is often used throughout Scripture as a picture of sin. Tonight, we remove the leaven from this place to symbolize God removing the impurity of sin from our lives. The Scriptures warn us:

“A little leaven works through the whole batch of dough.” (Galatians 5:9)

“Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy. There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, and nothing hidden that will not be made known. What you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the housetops.” (Luke 12:1–3)

“Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven works through the whole batch of dough? Get rid of the old leaven, that you may be a new unleavened batch, as you really are. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with the old bread, leavened with malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and of truth.” (1 Corinthians 5:6–8)

Like sin can be hidden in our hearts, leavened bread is hidden throughout this room. All the children can stand and try to find all the bread in the room. Once you find some bread, your need to bring it here in the open so that it can be removed.

*Instruct the children to find all of the leaven or leavened bread in the room. Bring it to the center and remove it from the room.*


#### People

Blessed are you, our God. It is you who makes us holy and commands us to go and sin no more. As a picture of our scorn of sin and worldly, lesser desires, we remove the leaven of this place. May we always be so fervent in removing those things that harm our relationship with you, harm our relationship with our neighbor, and harm ourselves. Any leaven which is in
our possession that we did not see, any sin in us that we did not see, which we did not remove, we leave in your hands to rid. Amen.

### Haroset and the Confession of Sin

*Hold up the apple mixture.*

#### Leader

This apple mixture (called haroset) is a sweet blend of apples, walnuts, honey, and cinnamon. The thick texture reminds us of the heavy bondage of sin, a bondage the Israelites felt during their time as Egyptian slaves. Their Egyptian taskmasters, “worked the Israelites ruthlessly and made their lives bitter with hard labor in brick and mortar ... [and] every service they imposed was harsh” (Exodus 1:14). Greater than the burden of brick and mortar, we were all burdened under the harsh rule of sin and Satan. But, God did not leave us in our bondage. In this way, the thick and sweet apple mixture reminds us of that genuine confession to God brings the sweetness of freedom and redemption.

Take a piece of matzah and put some haroset on it. Let us eat to remember the burden of sin and sweet freedom of confession.

*Eat the haroset.*

#### People

“O Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is loving devotion, and with Him is redemption in abundance. And He will redeem Israel from all iniquity.” (Psalm 130:7–8)

“Blessed is he whose transgressions are forgiven, whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man whose iniquity the Lord does not count against him, in whose spirit there is no deceit.” (Psalm 31:1–2)

### “There Is a Fountain”: A Confession Song

#### People

##### Verse 1
There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel’s veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains:
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

##### Verse 2
The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away:
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

##### Verse 3
Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its pow’r,
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved, to sin no more:
Be saved, to sin no more,
Be saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed Church of God
Be saved to sin no more.

##### Verse 4
E’er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die:
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

## Feasting in Faith: Celebrating Redemption in Christ

### Cup of Faith

*Hold up the cup.*

#### Leader

Once again, please pour the drink into your cup.


Tonight, we remember God’s gracious redemption for all who place their faith in Christ. God sent his Son into the world to rescue sinners from eternal judgment. For those who turn to Jesus in faith and repent from their sin, God offers freedom from guilt, shame, and fear. We drink this savory cup to symbolically remember the sweetness of God’s redemption. Let us drink together!

*Drink the cup.*

#### People

God who gives unending joy, we drink this cup in celebration of Your immeasurable greatness, imaginable generosity, and countless mercies. We love you! Amen.

#### Jesus as the Light of the World

*Point (or hold up) to the unlit candle.*

#### Leader

God sent his son, Jesus, into the world to save us from our sin. Into the darkness of a sinful and broken world, God sent the redeeming light of his Son, Jesus.

*Light the candle.*

#### People

“Jesus spoke to the people and said, ‘I am the light of the world. Whoever follows Me will never walk in the darkness, but will have the light of life.’” (John 8:12)

“In Him was life, and that life was the light of men. The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.” (John 1:4–5)

As the light of the world, Jesus rescues us from the darkness of sin, death, judgment. We celebrate this work of salvation on the cross. The Bible testifies to this work of salvation.

### Jesus as the Savior of the World

#### Leader

“The Son is the radiance of God's glory and the exact representation of His nature, upholding all things by His powerful word. After He had provided purification for sins, He sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high.” (Hebrews 1:3)

#### People

We confess, “[Jesus] you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” (Matthew 16:16).

#### Leader

“But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honor because He suffered death, so that by the grace of God He might taste death for everyone.” (Hebrews 2:9)

#### People

We confess, “[Jesus] you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” (Matthew 16:16).

#### Leader

“Now since the children have flesh and blood, He too shared in their humanity, so that by His death He might destroy him who holds the power of death, that is, the devil, and free those who all their lives were held in slavery by their fear of death.” (Hebrews 2:14–15)

#### People

We confess, “[Jesus] you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” (Matthew 16:16).

#### Leader

“For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin.” (Hebrews 4:15)

#### People

We confess, “[Jesus] you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” (Matthew 16:16).

#### Leader

“Therefore [Jesus] is able to save completely those who draw near to God through Him, since He always lives to intercede for them.” (Hebrews 7:25)

#### People

We confess, “[Jesus] you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” (Matthew 16:16).

#### Leader

“Just as man is appointed to die once, and after that to face judgment, so also Christ was offered once to bear the sins of many; and He will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly await Him.” (Hebrews 9:27–28)

#### People

We confess, “[Jesus] you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” (Matthew 16:16).

#### Leader

“But when [Christ] had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, He sat down at the right hand of God. Since that time, He waits for His enemies to be made a footstool for His feet, because by a single offering He has made perfect for all time those who are being sanctified.” (Hebrews 10:12–14)

#### People

We confess, “[Jesus] you are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” (Matthew 16:16).

### On This Night

#### Leader

Why is this night different from all other nights?

#### Children

On this night we remember Jesus’ suffering and death on the cross.

#### Leader

In what ways do you find this night, which is different from other nights,
affects all other nights?

#### Children

On this night we remember that Jesus **came to fulfill all of the law** so that on every other night we who believe in him **are declared righteous before God.**

On this night we remember that Jesus **was betrayed by one of his own disciples** so that on every other night we who believe in him **are reconciled to God and reconciled to one another.**

On this night we remember that Jesus **was beaten and physically suffered** so that on every other night we who believe in him **can endure and persevere until the end.**

On this night we remember that Jesus **was mocked and humiliated** so that on every other night we who believe in him **can live free from shame and disgrace.**

On this night we remember that Jesus **was falsely accused** so that on every other night we who believe in him **no longer live under the crushing weight of guilt.**

On this night we remember that Jesus **bore the curse by being hung on a tree** so that on every other night we who believe in him **can live with the promise and hope of eternal life as an anchor for our souls.**

#### Washing of Hands

*Hold up the water.*

#### Leader

We prepare ourselves for fellowship around an evening meal. We wash our hands in water as a symbol. Tonight, the cleansing effect of water reminds us that only the blood of Jesus can purify us from our sin and guilt.

*Dip your hands in water.*

### Preparation for the Main Meal

#### Leader

We now come to the main course of the evening. This main course reminds us that Jesus is the center of our faith. His rejection and betrayal at the hands of humanity secured our acceptance before God. His endurance through great suffering paved a path to rest and relief from the burden of sin. His sacrifice upon the cross was a payment that brings freedom from guilt and shame. Dying a gruesome death on the cross, his death has brought unending life for all who will believe in him. As we eat, we remember that Jesus is our real food and our real drink. Jesus tells us, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to Me will never hunger, and whoever believes in Me will never thirst." (John 6:35). Let us pray!

#### People

Loving God, Thank you for the gift of your Son. You did not abandon us to condemnation or forsake us to eternal judgment. In your wisdom and love, you have won salvation for sinful man. All praise be to our gracious and merciful God! Thank you for the food of this meal which reminds us of Jesus, the bread of life, the living water, and "the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world" (John 1:29). Amen.

#### Leader

Let’s enjoy a meal together!

### Main Meal Fellowship

*Fellowship together around the main meal.*

## Feasting in Obedience: Walking Faithfully in God’s Ways

### Cup of Obedience

*Hold up the cup.*

#### Leader

Once again, please pour the drink into your cup.

Tonight, we remember what it means to be a redeemed people: saved from sin, sanctified in godliness, and sent into the world on mission. We drink this cup to remember God’s call for us to live lives of purity and purpose in the world.

*Drink the cup.*

#### Leader

“For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to everyone. It instructs us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live sensible, upright, and godly lives in the present age, as we await the blessed hope and glorious appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. He gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for Himself a people for His own possession, zealous for good deeds.” (Titus 2:11–14)

### Salt and the Witness of God’s People

#### Leader

God calls us to season the world with the grace of the gospel and the testimony of our lives. Jesus teaches us, “You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its savor, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men” (Matthew 5:13). Paul also instructs us, “Act wisely toward outsiders, redeeming the time. Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone” (Colossians 4:4–5).

We dip our finger into the bowl of salt water and spread it to the ground. Do it a second time. Do it a third time.

#### People

May we be the salt of the earth!

### Light and the Witness of God’s People

*Point (or hold up) to the candle.*

#### Leader

God calls us to shine the light of his Son, Jesus, into the world. Jesus tells us, “While you have the Light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of light” (John 12:36).

“You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket. Instead, they set it on a stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light
shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.” (Matthew 5:14–16)

Finally, we light the candles on our table.

*Light candles at individual tables.*

#### People

May we be the light of world!

### Seeking God’s Gracious Help

#### Leader

“After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself restore you, secure you, strengthen you, and establish you. To Him be the power forever and ever. Amen.” (1 Peter 5:10–11)

#### People

Most Holy God, you make us holy through the blood of your Son, Jesus Christ. We drink this cup as a symbol of the Blood that not only saves us but sanctifies us. Amen!

### Be Thou My Vision: A Petition Song


#### Verse 1
Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
Thou my best Thought, by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.


#### Verse 2

Be Thou my Wisdom, and Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

#### Verse 3

Riches I heed not, nor man’s empty praise,
Thou mine Inheritance, now and always:
Thou and Thou only, first in my heart,
High King of heaven, my Treasure Thou art.

#### Verse 4

High King of heaven, my victory won,
May I reach heaven’s joys, O bright heaven’s Sun!
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
Still be my Vision, O Ruler of all.



## Feasting in Hope: Looking Forward to the Life to Come

### Cup of Hope

*Hold up the cup.*

#### Leader

One last time, please pour the drink into your cup. Fill your cup to the full.

Tonight, we remember in hope. In as much as tonight is a celebration of salvation, it is also a night of anticipation. We trust in Christ’s death, knowing that three days later he rose again from the dead. We claim the sacrifice of Christ as our pardon from judgment, while at the same time remembering that Christ ascended to his Father’s throne. In Christ we are freed from the power of sin, but we long for the day when the very presence of evil will be vanquished. As we follow Jesus as our Good Shepherd, the one who came into the world to save the lost, we look forward to Jesus’ second coming
when he will triumph over all his enemies like a conquering king. To symbolize our sure and certain hope and our present pilgrimage on this earth, we leave our cups filled, as we await the celebration of Jesus’ resurrection from the dead.

Put down the cup on the table. Leave it full and do not drink from it.

*Leave the full cup on the table without drinking from it.*

#### Grapes and the Future Promise

*Hold up a vine of grapes.*

#### Leader

We leave this cup full to remember the decisive victory of Jesus’ resurrection and the final redemption that will come at Jesus’ second coming. As sojourners of faith, we await our full redemption in the life to come. As Israel awaited their entrance into the promised land of Canaan, they knew it as a land "flowing with milk and honey” (Numbers 13:27) and a land of lush fruit—grapes, pomegranates, and figs (Numbers 13:23–24). We too look forward to a future world where God’s good promises will come to full fruition.

At this time, the children will pass out grapes by bringing a cluster of grapes to each table. We eat these grapes as a reminder of our hope for unending life in the world to come.

*Eat a grape from the vine.*

#### Leader

“The creation waits in eager expectation for the revelation of the sons of God.” (Romans 8:19)

#### People

Amen! Come, risen Lord Jesus!

#### Leader

#### People

Amen! Come, risen Lord Jesus!

### Amazing Grace: A Celebration Song

#### Verse 1
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

#### Verse 2
’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

#### Verse 3

Through many dangers toils and snares
I have already come
’Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

#### Verse 4

When we’ve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we’ve first begun

## A Last Word: Benediction and Blessing

#### Leader

“Now may the God of peace, who through the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great Shepherd of the sheep, equip you with every good thing to do His will. And may He accomplish in us what is pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.” (Hebrews 13:20–21)


## Postlude

As the feast concludes, greet one another with the following blessing:

#### People

“The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.” (Romans 16:20)
