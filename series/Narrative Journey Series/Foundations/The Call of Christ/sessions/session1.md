## Introduction

> He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed. 1 Peter 2:24–25

> Christ [is] the very essence of all delights and pleasures, the very soul and substance of them. As all the rivers are gathered into the ocean, which is congregation or meeting-place of all waters in the world: so Christ is that ocean in which all true delights and pleasures meet. John Flavel, _The Method of Grace_

Jesus is calling you to follow him. Christianity is more than an idea, a philosophy, or a belief system. At its very core, the Christian life involves faithful submission to Jesus Christ in every area of one’s life. A true disciple—a follower of Christ—no longer lives for one’s own interests and no longer prioritizes one’s own self-will. Rather, disciples recognize Jesus as sovereign king of the universe and therefore as rightful king of their own lives. Said simply, the life of a Christian disciple begins by trusting Jesus as one’s Savior and submitting to him as one’s Master and Lord. In this act, disciples escape the ruin of the present world by entrusting themselves to Jesus for the forgiveness of their sins.

There are many ways to describe what is wrong with the present life. Disobeying God, humans have brought sorrow, pain, and death into God’s good world. Brokenness, dysfunction, and turmoil now characterize the world which God originally created to flourish and thrive. Human rebellion has injected enmity—a deeply fracturing hostility—between God and people. Now as enemies of Almighty God, humans are lost in spiritual exile, wandering through life on paths leading to destruction. Spiritually alienated, people are estranged from God: once enjoying deep and intimate fellowship with the Creator, the relationship between God and humans has ruptured. Against the purity of God’s perfect and holy character, even the slightest sin amounts to cosmic treachery and spiritual infidelity. All humans are born into this broken world infected and diseased by sin, stained by moral wrongdoing, and burdened by the curse. In this sinful state, all of us are naturally inclined to seek our own pleasure, prone to a self-indulgence that produces self-destructive patterns and unfruitful life habits. Effectively, we have become the captains of our own ruin.

But God has not left us in our helpless and hopeless condition. A loving Creator wanting to be reconciled with his creation, God sent his Son into the world to rescue sinners and restore his world. In this work of grace, God provided a way for the brokenness of life to be mended, the stain of sin to be cleansed, the shame of guilt to be removed, the fellowship with God to be restored, and the decay of God’s creation to be repaired. At its heart, the message of Christianitythe core teaching of the Bible—is good news that God graciously saves and redeems his fallen creation. The first step to be a follower of Christ is to receive the good news of this gospel into your own life.

In the powerful narrative of Acts 2:1–36, we hear the gospel message clearly and boldly proclaimed. After the Holy Spirit empowered the early gathering of Christ-followers, Peter stood up and delivered a speech in which he told his listeners how they could be saved from their sin. He explained how prophets predicted that God would send his deliverer to bring salvation to his people. These prophecies were fulfilled when God sent his Son, Jesus, into the world. Remaining fully God, Jesus was born as a human and became like us in every way, except he never committed any sin. He performed many miraculous deeds, showing people the power of God’s kingdom. Although innocent and sinless, Jesus was crucified on a cross to bear divine punishment for human sinners. He rose again from the dead, made many appearances to his followers, and ascended to his Father in heaven. Exalted in heaven, Jesus rules and reigns as ultimate king and waits to one day return again to earth to set all things right. For all who place their trust in Christ, they receive the forgiveness of sins.

Jesus is calling people to follow him. Being a follower of Christ is to believe the gospel message, receive Jesus as your Savior, and surrender to him as your Lord. By placing your faith in Jesus, believers in Christ are made new, transformed by the power of God’s grace. Only through Jesus can the tragedy of sin be upended and the brokenness of the cursed world be repaired. In this way, as much as Peter’s message was an announcement of hope for its first listeners, it continues to be a word of deliverance and redemption for us today, for all who would heed God’s voice to follow his Son.

#### Passage Introduction

##### Key Idea

Jesus is calling people to place their trust in him as Savior and Lord.

### Introduction

In Christ, sinful humans can be restored to a joyous and satisfying relationship with God. God has fulfilled his ancient promises to rescue his fallen creation. He brought these promises to fruition by sending his Son, Jesus, as the long-awaited deliverer. Fully God, Jesus was born into this world, took on human flesh, lived a perfect life, performed miraculous deeds, was crucified on the cross, resurrected from the dead, ascended to heaven, and promised to return to earth to set all things right. All who genuinely believe in Jesus receive the forgiveness of sins and are spared from God’s judgment.

This message of salvation forms the foundation of the Christian life. To help us understand this foundational message, we will explore Acts 2:1–36. This biblical narrative recounts a crucial moment in human history. At this time, God sent his Holy Spirit to come upon Jesus’ earliest disciples. Through the Spirit, they were supernaturally empowered to speak foreign languages. Peter, a leader among Jesus’ disciples, stood up and explained to the surrounding crowd that this miraculous event was a sign that God was fulfilling his former promises, that God was bringing his plan of salvation to fruition. After explaining the significance of this event, Peter preached a sermon in which he summarized the core elements of the gospel.

Peter’s gospel message records the foundational narrative of Jesus accomplishing salvation for sinful humanity. Although the events of Jesus’ saving work took place over two thousand years ago, transformative repentance and belief rooted in these events remain the only way for humans to be reconciled to God. Even though Peter preached this message to a first century audience, its record in the Bible is a direct message to us, enjoining us to place our faith in Christ. As we study this narrative, may you hear and heed this ancient message as God’s invitation to you today in which Jesus is calling you to turn from the empty, hollow life of sin and instead to follow him, receiving the promises of eternal life and forgiveness of sins.

### It Shall Come to Pass: God Bringing His Plan of Salvation to Fruition

_Biblical Narrative (Acts 2:1–21)._

During the feast of Pentecost (a Jewish feast called the Feast of Weeks, celebrated for 50 days [seven weeks and one day] after Passover in which Jews rejoiced in God’s provision of the harvest), Jews from various countries traveled to Jerusalem to participate in the festivities. Just prior to this time, Jesus had risen from the dead, and appeared to many of his disciples over a period of 40 days (Acts 1:1–3). Days prior to Pentecost, Jesus ascended to heaven before the eyes of his disciples (1:4–11). The disciples were told to wait in Jerusalem until God sent the Holy Spirit to come upon them (1:4–5, 8). God promised to send his Holy Spirit to empower his disciples to be witnesses of Jesus throughout the whole world (1:6–8).

At the time “the day of Pentecost arrived,” the disciples were gathered together in a house (2:1). The Holy Spirit suddenly came upon the community of disciples with “sound like a mighty rushing wind ... and it filled the entire house where they were sitting” (2:2). In a miraculous event, the Holy Spirit empowered the disciples to speak in other languages (2:3–4). People from various countries (cf. 2:7–11) heard the disciples speaking in languages they could understand (2:5–6). The crowd was bewildered (2:6), amazed (2:7, 12), astonished (2:7), and perplexed (2:12) by this. They wondered how these disciples from Galilee could speak the languages of so many different countries (2:7–11). People marveled at how such a miraculous thing could have happened (2:8) and wondered what this miraculous event meant (2:12). Some mocked the group of disciples and said they were drunk (2:13).

In response, Peter stood up and addressed the crowd. He told the crowd that they were not drunk but that the miraculous event was a fulfillment of a prophecy God had given long ago (2:14–16). Peter explained that God promised that a day would come when God would “pour out [his] Spirit on all flesh” (2:17) and his people would prophesy (2:17–18). God would bring about wonders and signs before the final day of judgment would come (2:19-20). This would bring to fruition God’s promise that “it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” (2:21). The coming of the Spirit, the speaking in miraculous tongues, and the signs and wonders of this event showed that God was fulfilling his promises to deliver all people who would earnestly call upon God for salvation.

_Biblical Principles._

The dramatic events of Acts 2:1–21 are evidence of God’s powerful and sovereign hand intervening in human affairs. Without God’s intervention, humans would be tragically consigned to condemnation. Truly, salvation is only possible by God graciously intervening in human affairs. A basic truth of the gospel is that God did not remain distant and uninvolved after humans rebelled in sin. Instead, God outstretched his arm and rescued humans from a pending punishment people had brought upon themselves. For thousands of years, God gave advanced notice—that is, he announced his saving intentions through prophecies—that he would rescue people from their sin.

In the narrative before us, God was fulfilling his promises to save sinful humans. From the time of humanity’s rebellion (and even before), God designed a plan by which he would save his fallen creation. The coming of the Spirit in Acts 2:1–21 was a sign that God was bringing “to pass” (or fulfilling) his promises that “everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” (2:21). Now salvation was possible because of all that Jesus accomplished. As Lord and Christ, Jesus of Nazareth’s birth, life, ministry, death, resurrection, appearance, ascension, and reign was the great work that achieved deliverance and salvation for humans. This redemptive work was previously recorded by Luke in his prior narrative (cf. Luke 1:1–24:53; Acts 1:1–26) and it would be subsequently recounted by Peter in his gospel message in Acts 2:22–36.

God accomplished his plan of salvation in human history. The events surrounding Jesus’ time on earth were actual historical events that took place in the world. In the same way, the coming of the Holy Spirit was a capstone to this great work of redemption. It signaled that God was bringing salvation to fruition and making it possible for sinful humans to be reconciled to God. Because these events were sealed in human history, God’s promise of salvation is available to all who are willing to call “upon the name of the Lord” (2:21).

### God’s Definite Plan: God Fulfilling His Promises in Christ

_Biblical Narrative (Acts 2:23, 25–31, 33–35; cf. 2:14–21)._

Jesus’ coming to earth fulfilled God’s many promises (cf. 2:14–21). God promised that he would send a deliverer into the world. In times long ago, “God had sworn with an oath...that he would set one of [David’s] descendants on his throne” (2:30). Since Jesus was born in the lineage of David, Jesus fulfilled this prophecy. Jesus also fulfilled God’s promises in the manner of his death. Jesus was crucified on the cross “according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God” (2:23). In reference to Jesus’ resurrection, David made a prediction in Psalm 16:8–11 about Jesus coming back to life. In this way, David was “being...a prophet” (2:30), “foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ” (2:31) when he wrote Psalm 16:10 (cf. 2:27, 31). Additionally, Jesus was exalted at God’s right hand (2:34) and fulfilled God’s promise to establish his kingdom rule. When Jesus ascended to heaven, he brought forth “the promise of the Holy Spirit” (2:33) which fulfilled Old Testament prophecies that God’s Spirit would empower his people (cf. 2:16–21). Also similarly fulfilled, David prophesied that sometime in the future Jesus would conquer all of God’s enemies (2:35).

_Biblical Principles._

God had been announcing the good news of the gospel for hundreds of years before Jesus came to earth to accomplish God’s redemptive plan. Prophets foretold that God would send a promised deliverer to rescue sinful humanity (cf. 2 Samuel 7:12–16; Isaiah 11:1–5, 10; 52:13–53:12; Jeremiah 23:5–6; Ezekiel 37:24–28; Micah 5:2; Zechariah 9:9; 12:10–13:1). In Acts 2:22–36, Peter mentioned several ways that Jesus’ coming fulfilled God’s promises: Jesus’ incarnation (i.e., Jesus’ birth as a human being), (2:30; cf. 2:22), Jesus’ crucifixion (2:23), Jesus’ resurrection (2:25–31), Jesus’ ascension and exaltation (2:30, 33), and the coming of the Holy Spirit (2:33; cf. 2:17–21). Humanity had longed for a Messiah—the long-announced divine deliverer—to redeem them from the brokenness of the sinful world. This mounting anticipation came to fruition at the coming of Christ. In this specific person—fully God and fully man—God brought his promised plan of salvation to a climax (2:22–23, 32, 36). Within this plan of salvation are yet more promises—future assurances—for all who place their faith in Christ: forgiveness of sin, nearness to God, resurrection from the dead, eternal life, and a perfected world to come. God’s proven faithfulness to keep his ancient promises—those fulfilled by Christ’s coming—gives profound confidence that all of God’s gospel promises have a bright and glorious (and guaranteed!) future.

### In Your Midst: God Revealing Himself in Jesus

_Biblical Narrative (Acts 2:22)._

During his earthly life, Jesus performed many extraordinary deeds as he ministered to others. Peter explained that Jesus was “attested...by God with mighty works and wonders and signs” (2:22). During his ministry, Jesus performed healings, exorcisms, and other miracles. Peter explained to the crowd that these mighty works, wonders, and signs were performed “in your midst, as you yourselves know” (2:22). Although Jesus’ ultimate act of salvation was his work on the cross (crucifixion and resurrection), the miraculous deeds revealed Jesus’ power, identity, and redemptive purpose. Through these deeds, Jesus served others, revealed the essence of God’s kingdom reign, and verified that he was God’s chosen deliverer.

_Biblical Principles._

In a gracious and humbling act, God’s eternal Son, Jesus, was born into the world as a human being. He lived and experienced human existence in every way that humans do, except Jesus remained perfect and without sin. He truly was the “Holy One” (2:27). But Jesus demonstrated great compassion and love toward people. During his years on earth, Jesus ministered to many people. Through his mighty works, wonders, and signs (2:22) Jesus cared for people in difficult and trying situations. As he cared for people through his miraculous deeds and good works, Jesus also revealed his kingdom purpose and divine identity. The gospel is good news because Jesus came to broken humanity. God did not rely upon broken humanity—limping in sin and rebellion—to take the initiative to return back to God. Although Jesus’ ministry on earth took place nearly two thousand years ago, the deliverance, restoration, healing, and renewal that he brought about in his earthly ministry is promised to those who turn from their sin and pledge their allegiance to Christ. The same divine power witnessed by those in Jesus’ day, is available to all who place their faith in Christ. Whether such healing is experienced in this life or in the life promised in the world to come, Christian disciples treasure the good news that only Jesus brings God’s kingdom reality—the promise of restoration and renewal of all things—to full and final fruition.

### Jesus’ Crucifixion

_Biblical Narrative (Acts 2:23, 36)._

Jesus’ ministry climaxed in crucifixion on a cross. Although Jesus was innocent and sinless, he was “crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men” (2:23). It was not only those who crucified Jesus who were guilty (2:36). All humans are sinful, and the guilt of sinful humanity—sinful people from all generations and places—was responsible for Jesus’ death on the cross. Although it may seem like his death was a tragic end to a powerful ministry, Jesus’ death on the cross was an integral part of God’s plan to save sinful humans. Jesus was “delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God” (2:23). God punished his Son, Jesus, on the cross as a means to remove human guilt: Jesus was punished for human sin so that all who believe in Jesus can have their sins forgiven and escape divine punishment.

_Biblical Principles._

The good news of the gospel centers upon Jesus’ crucifixion on the cross. This selfless and sacrificial act involved Jesus voluntarily offering his life as a sacrifice for sin. The innocent, sinless, and perfect Jesus was killed on a cross by guilty, sinful, and lawless humanity (2:23, 36). Importantly, Peter is calling the very people responsible for the death of Jesus to receive forgiveness of their sins by placing their faith in Jesus (cf. 2:37–41). In the greatest act of love and mercy ever performed, Jesus was punished for human sin (although he was without sin) so that human sinners who believe in him would not be punished. What may seem like tragic news—the promised Messiah brutally and unjustly killed on a cross—is actually the greatest news ever told. In this act of sacrifice and substitution, Jesus accomplished God’s plan to save sinful humanity.

### Jesus’ Resurrection

_Biblical Narrative (Acts 2:24–32)._

Jesus died on a cross as part of God’s plan to save sinful humanity. Jesus’ crucifixion successfully resolves human sin because Jesus resurrected from the dead. After Jesus died, “God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death” (2:24). God prophesied that Jesus would rise again from the dead (2:25–28, 29–32). Jesus coming back to life fulfilled God’s promises that God would “not abandon [Jesus] to Hades, or let [his] Holy One see corruption” (2:27; cf. 2:31). It also fulfilled God’s promise to establish the reign of his promised king (2:29–30). Not only a witness of Jesus’ crucifixion, Christ’s disciples bore witness to the fact that Jesus had risen from the dead. Through the resurrection, the tragedy of death gave way to gladness (2:28; cf. 2:26), joy (2:26), hope (2:26), security (2:25), and “the paths of life” (2:28). The new life Jesus gained in his resurrection is promised to all who believe in Christ.

_Biblical Principles._

Had Jesus remained dead, the gospel would not be good news. If the crucifixion is the center of the gospel message, Jesus’ resurrection is its climax. In fact, Peter spends the majority of his sermon (2:24–32) detailing the reality that Jesus had come back to life. In this great act of power, majesty, and life, Jesus proved that he was God’s promised deliverer and the rightful king of the universe. In Jesus’ resurrection, he conquered great enemies that assault humanity: he defeated death, vanquished Satan, disarmed the evil forces, and overpowered sin. Jesus’ resurrection was the great healing balm to remedy the world’s gravest issues. At a cosmic level, Jesus’ resurrection brought about the hope of new beginnings, new creation, and new humanity. For each individual believer, Jesus’ resurrection guarantees eternal life—unending, resurrection life—with the fullness of joy in the presence of God (cf. 2:28). For those who are sober about the fragility and frailty of life, to have hope of life beyond the grave is good news that gives reason for boundless celebration.

### Jesus’ Ascension, Exaltation, Reign

_Biblical Narrative (Acts 2:33–34)._

After Jesus rose again from the dead, he appeared to many witnesses who testified that he truly came back to life. Following these appearances, Jesus ascended to heaven where he still sits at the right hand of God the Father (2:34). Jesus’ exaltation to heaven resulted in “the promise of the Holy Spirit” being “poured out” (2:33). The miraculous coming of the Holy Spirit witnessed by this crowd (cf. 2:1–21) was the next phase in God’s redemptive work. Having accomplished redemption through his death and resurrection, Jesus sent the Holy Spirit as a sign of God bringing salvation to sinful humanity. At the present time, Jesus is exalted in heaven and rules as rightful king of all things. The fact that Jesus is alive and reigning today makes it possible for his disciples to follow him in faith. The Christian life is more than a matrix of ideas. Rather, it is a lifestyle of submission to the rule and reign of Christ.

_Biblical Principles._

When Jesus rose from the dead, he publicly and universally validated his rightful place as king. When he lived on the earth, Jesus was not treated with the majesty of a king. But Jesus is the true and righteous king. Jesus’ resurrection appearances, ascension to heaven, exaltation at God’s right hand, and rule as king (2:30, 33–34) are hugely important as elements of the gospel message. Disciples from all generations and cultures continue to place their faith in Christ. But this faith in Jesus is not belief simply in the idea of Jesus. Rather, it is a deep and abiding allegiance to King Jesus, who is alive and ruling from heaven today. For disciples of Christ, it is comforting to know that his righteous rule over the cosmos involves protecting, preserving, and safekeeping his people through the trials and sufferings of this life.

### Jesus’ Return

_Biblical Narrative (Acts 2:35)._

The gospel message anticipates a second coming of Christ. Exalted at the right hand of God the Father, Jesus waits until he makes God’s enemies a footstool (2:35). In his first coming, Jesus came to save sinful humanity through his death on the cross and resurrection from the dead. Jesus will bring salvation to full fruition when he returns a second time to establish God’s full and final rule over all things. The salvation that Christians enjoy now is real, secure, and definitive. However, it awaits a full consummation when Jesus comes back to earth. Without this second coming salvation from sin would not be tasted in its fullness.

_Biblical Principles._

One day, Jesus will return to earth. In his first coming, Jesus was born as a human in a humble and lowly state. In his second coming, Jesus will come to establish the rule of God’s kingdom once and for all. Although we do not see Jesus now, we know that he is alive and well, ruling the cosmos from his heavenly throne. World events, social happenings, family development, and personal circumstances all take place as Christ reigns supreme. One day, Christ will return to fully and finally fix the brokenness of the world. Upon his return, he will destroy evil, remove sin, restore the world, and transform his people into a glorified state where they will live in perfect harmony with God for all time. Jesus’ return is the capstone of the gospel message. It promises that followers of Christ today are guaranteed a full and flourishing life in the world to come.

### Jesus’ Identity

_Biblical Narrative (Acts 2:22–23, 27, 30–31, 34, 36)._

After explaining how the coming of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples (cf. 2:1–13) was a sign of God fulfilling his redemptive promises (cf. 2:14–21), Peter recounted how God achieved salvation on behalf of sinful humanity. In the speech that followed, Peter delivered a message that recounted God’s saving work in the gospel. At the beginning of his gospel message, Peter summoned his listeners to “hear these words” (2:22). The next words define the basic subject matter of the gospel: “Jesus of Nazareth” (2:22). At its core, the gospel message is about Jesus. The essence of the Christian life is a matter of devoting one’s life to following Jesus. Since this is the case, it is crucial to understand “this Jesus” (2:23; cf. 2:32) for who he really is.

Jesus is God’s eternal Son (fully God for all time) who came to earth by taking on human flesh (born as a human). At the beginning of Peter’s speech, he identified Jesus as “a man attested to you by God” (2:22). When God sent his Son to the world, he became a man. While Jesus became fully human, Jesus is simultaneously “both Lord and Christ” (2:36). Peter quotes from Psalm 110:1 in which “the Lord said to my Lord” (2:34). This is God (i.e., “the Lord”) speaking to another person with an equal status of God (i.e., “my Lord”). Jesus is identified as distinct from God the Father but equal to God the Father. Jesus is the divine Lord and the promised deliverer (2:30–31, 36) of sinful humanity. Jesus is also referred to as the “Holy One” (2:27). Jesus is perfect, without sin, and set apart for God’s work. In sum, Jesus is fully God and fully human in one person.

Biblical Principles. At its core, the gospel message is a message about Jesus. Peter makes this clear in his sermon. Repeatedly, Peter draws his listener’s attention back to who Jesus is (2:22–23, 27, 30–31, 32, 34, 36). What people think about Jesus (and whether people are for or against him) is the most important thing about them. If Jesus is simply a moral teacher, extraordinary wonderworker, or insightful spiritual leader, he cannot be humanity’s Savior. Jesus can only be the Savior of sinful humanity—the promised divine deliverer—if he is fully God and fully human in one person. His holiness before God allows him to be offered on the cross as a _sufficient sacrifice_—a perfect and sinless offering for sin that God would accept. Jesus’ full humanity allows him to be a _suitable substitute_ for humans—being punished for sin in place of sinful humanity. In Jesus, the demands of a holy God are satisfied in a way mercy can be extended to humans, forgiving their sins. Jesus’ actions on earth—his life, ministry, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, exaltation, and reign—are of saving significance because of who Jesus is. In this way, the good news of the gospel—the joyous message announced to fallen humans—is contained in Jesus himself.

### In Short: The Salvation Core of the Christian Faith

The gospel can be summarized in four basic ideas. First, the good news of the gospel begins with bad news: humans are sinful and guilty before a holy and righteous God (2:23, 36; 2:38). The rebellion of the first humans and our own personal sinfulness separate us from God, multiply brokenness in the world, fracture relationships with others, and corrupt our very human nature. All humans are born into the fallen world as sinners. We all deserve God’s wrath and punishment for our sin. God’s fallen creation is in desperate and urgent need of salvation and the forgiveness of sin (2:21, 38).

Despite our sinfulness, God did not leave us in our broken and dysfunctional state. In his great love and mercy, he performed a great act of salvation on behalf of sinful humans. This act of salvation is the second core idea of the gospel: God sent his Son, Jesus, as a promised deliverer to rescue sinful humans from eternal condemnation. For many years, God had promised that he would send a deliverer. (2:30; cf. 2:23). At just the right time in human history, Jesus was born into the world and became fully human (although he remained fully God) (2:22, 30 2:36). Jesus is fully God and fully human in one person (2:22, 27, 34, 36). Jesus lived a perfect life and did deeds of power and mercy that showed his identity and the nature of God’s kingdom rule (2:22). Through teaching and ministry, Jesus gave people a picture of the world the way that it should be. According to God’s plan, Jesus died on the cross, being punished for human sin (2:23, 36). Jesus overcame sin, evil, and death by coming back to life (2:24-32). He made many appearances to his disciples to prove his resurrection (2:33). After many days, Jesus ascended to heaven where currently reigns with God over all things (2:33–34). When Jesus ascended to heaven, the Holy Spirit came to empower God’s people (2:33). One day, Jesus will return to earth to fully establish God’s kingdom (2:35). This great narrative about Jesus occurred in human history. Through this work, Jesus accomplished salvation for sinful humans.

The great work of salvation that Jesus accomplished is applied to the lives of sinful humans when they rightly respond to the gospel. This highlights a third foundation of the gospel: salvation is received as sinners turn from sin and place their faith in Christ (2:37–41). The fact of Jesus dying and rising again does not result in salvation for every single human being. Sinners must rightly respond to the gospel—humbly receive it in repentance and faith—in order to be saved. The gospel is not only a message of human sinfulness and a narrative of Jesus’ saving work, it is also an invitation to receive God’s salvation in Christ. Although turning from sin and placing faith in Christ is a costly act of surrender, allegiance, and devotion, God offers his salvation freely to any who would respond in this way. Last, the gospel involves the promise of a transformed life. The message of the gospel is a warning of the consequences of sin, the narrative of Jesus’ saving work, an invitation to respond in faith, and a promise of eternal blessings and benefits to those who receive God’s free offer of salvation. Upon receiving the gospel, believers receive forgiveness of sins (2:38), nearness to God (2:39), the gift of the Holy Spirit (2:33, 38–39), and participation in a faith community (2:41). Truly, believers in Christ enjoy the promise given by the prophet: “everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved” (2:21).

### Conclusion

At its core, the gospel promises unending life to all who place their trust in Christ. Jesus is Savior of the lost, Redeemer of the broken, Deliverer of the sinner, and Lord of the wayward. The gospel is good news because God has provided a gracious solution to our sinful condition. Without God mercifully intervening for our salvation, the tragedy of human sin would certainly result in eternal death and never-ending torment. Rather than leaving humans to destruction, God lovingly secured salvation for the lost by placing his judgment upon his Son. In Christ, God provides a sure remedy for human sinfulness.

Your life will be defined by your relationship to Jesus. If you place your faith in Christ, forgiveness, pardon, and salvation are guaranteed to you. Jesus alone can transform your present life of sin and make you innocent before a holy God. However, if you reject Christ, you face the consequences of eternal judgment. Humans are incapable of resolving the perilous predicament of human sin. But, Christ has already paved the way to redemption, healing the fractured relationship with God. By faith in Christ, you can respond to Jesus’ call to follow him, a response to enter the paths of life.

### Spiritual Practice: Letters from the Grave

> Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him. Hebrews 9:28

> I do believe and confess that Christ’s condemnation is my absolution [pardon], that His crucifying is my deliverance, His descending into hell is my ascending into heaven, His death is my life, His blood is my cleansing and purging, by whom only I am washed, purified and cleansed from all my sins ... the blood of Jesus Christ ... purged and made clean forever .... Jesus Christ, by the sacrifice of his body, which he offered upon the tree of the cross, hath defaced and destroyed sin, death and the devil, with all his kingdom; and hath wholly performed the work of our salvation. John Hooper, _The Christian Faith_

God sent his Son, Jesus, as his promised deliverer to rescue sinful humans from pending judgment. Jesus is fully God: he is Lord and Christ. When Jesus was born into the world, he became fully human: he was born as Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus lived a perfect and holy life. In his ministry, he performed miraculous deeds. He was crucified, rose again from the dead, appeared to his disciples, ascended into heaven, sent the Holy Spirit, and will one day return to establish God’s full and final reign over all things. All who place their faith in Christ and believe in this message receive the forgiveness of sins and life unending. Use the following exercise to clarify your understanding of this gospel message and to internalize its truth in your own heart.
