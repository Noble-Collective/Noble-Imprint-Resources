## Introduction

> But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen. 2 Peter 3:18

> I cannot imagine how religious persons can live satisfied without the practice of _the presence of God_. For my part, as I can, I keep myself retired with Him in the very centre of my soul; and, when I am so with him, I fear no evil. Brother Lawrence, _The Practice of the Presence of God_

God is inviting us into deep and intimate communion with himself. Herein lies our most satisfying and flourishing life. The fullness of human experience, the depth of heartfelt joy, and the excitement of life purpose are all realized in the presence of God. Unlike anything else, God’s presence animates, sustains, and enriches life. The most meaningful life is lived with a daily awareness of God’s presence: faithfully living under the eye of an all-knowing and ever-gracious God. Even more, the substance of a faithful Christian life involves the intentional and devoted _practice of God’s presence_: learning Christian habits that cultivate a daily walk with the Lord. Certainly, Jesus came to earth to fulfill Old Testament promises, to suffer empathetically with his people, to open the way for forgiveness of sins by dying on the cross, and to secure victory over sin, Satan, and death through his resurrection power. But Jesus also showed his disciples how to live a faithful life. Jesus not only restored people to a relationship with God; he also epitomized a devoted life and exemplified the practices of daily living in God’s presence. In God’s gracious work of redeeming sinners, God does not merely save people to a static and inert existence; Jesus wins a people to himself and ushers them into a thriving and vibrant relationship with God.

A Christian spiritual life is not easy. Any number of challenges, distractions, and impediments confront God’s people as they pursue fellowship with God. As people pursue progress in the faith, they can expect a barrage of opposition. Old life habits and dysfunctional relationships of the past can ensnare new disciples. Temptations can subtly seduce faithful followers away from God’s revealed truth. Neglect, passivity, and inactivity are ever-lurking threats to spiritual maturity. While God’s people pursue spiritual progress against the currents and trends of contemporary culture, they also walk with God in the midst of an ensuing spiritual battle. Lack of biblical instruction and the absence of spiritual mentors also make faith formation a great difficulty. Despite these ubiquitous challenges, it is possible to grow in the faith and enjoy meaningful communion with God. God invites us to a life of spiritual progress that his enabling grace makes possible. God himself—with his undeterred power and unrelenting mercy—is the means by which Christian growth is possible. The grace of Christ, which purchased salvation for sinners, is the same grace that enables God’s people to surmount spiritual obstacles, experience life transformation, cultivate spiritual habits, and enjoy a life of maturity and intimacy with God. The Scriptures are a sure guide for this walk of faith.

Luke 2:21–52 details the interesting and greatly instructive account of Jesus’ infancy and early youth. In this narrative, the Bible tells us about the spiritual devotion and faith practices of Jesus’ family. Soon after Jesus’ birth, Jesus’ parents followed God’s Law in the practices of circumcision, consecration, and purification. In addition to a godly family, Jesus was also surrounded by a vibrant faith community, represented by the godly Simeon and prophetic Anna, who both rejoiced when Jesus was brought into the temple. Although Jesus was perfect and sinless, he grew, developed, and matured throughout his young years. Eventually, Jesus demonstrated his faith maturity by engaging religious leaders in an impressive conversation about the matters of the faith. This narrative not only showcases Jesus’ maturity, but it also establishes us in basic teachings about Christian life.

The life of faith was never meant to be static or stationary. God invites his people to continuous growth, ongoing development, and progressive maturation. Our progress in the faith is a direct result of meaningful and regular communion with the Lord: practicing God’s presence. As Jesus’ own life demonstrates, spiritual discipline and faith practices are fundamental facets of Christian formation. From Luke’s account of Jesus’ youth, we learn that Jesus is not only the pioneer of our faith—accomplishing redemption for us—but also the exemplar of how to live out our faith. Jesus is the author of the gospel, the embodiment of the law, and the model for disciples on how to grow through spiritual practice. Thankfully, we are not left to aimless wandering in our faith journey. Jesus leads the way forward, showing us what it looks like to live a life of faith, nurtured in spiritual habit, practicing the presence of God, and experiencing ongoing life transformation. As we glimpse into the early years of Jesus’ life, let us reshape our thinking, reform our lifestyles, and retrain our life habits after Jesus’ example. In Jesus, God has not only given us the _pattern_ but also the _means_ by which we can grow in our spiritual life.

In this record of Jesus’ infancy and youth, we see the devotion of his family and faith community as a fertile context in which Jesus displays his own commitment to God the Father. Jesus came to earth not only to rescue humans from the bonds of sin but also to show how to live a vibrant spiritual life. He is the embodiment of a life of spiritual practice and faith progress. Use the following commentary to help you understand the role of spiritual discipline in the journey of the Christian life and faith maturation.

#### Seeing Jesus as a Model for Faith Formation

> One thing I have asked of the Lord; this is what I desire: to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of the Lord and seek Him in His temple. Psalm 27:4

> Good examples have a powerful influence upon us, for we are led more by pattern than by precept, especially the examples of those we love, for such we are prone to imitate; but more especially of those who are in nearest relation to us, for there nature sides with grace. Thomas Manton, _Complete Works_

##### Introduction

To be a Christian is to keep company with God and his people. The immense joy of communion with God includes fellowship with other believers and involves continuous progress and transformation in the faith. To be in such a relationship with God is astounding, as it is inspiring. While the good news of the gospel is a promise of reconciliation with God—_a restored relationship with the Creator of all things_—the Christian life is an invitation to ongoing fellowship with the King of the universe—_a daily communion with the Sovereign God_. The transformative moment of our new birth ushers us into a spiritual life that must be cultivated, developed, and nurtured. Importantly, our growth in faith is directly connected with our witness of Christ to the surrounding world. In essence, the journey of the Christian life is a faith pilgrimage of daily practicing the presence of God through transformative practices, with the community of God’s people, and in service of God’s world purposes.

Many genuine believers have never been shown the means of cultivating a life of intimacy with God. Others have experienced transformation in the life of faith only to slump into a season in which dulled spiritual senses and casual commitment to the Lord have resulted in lukewarm devotion, lackadaisical practice, lackluster obedience, and lustful fetishes of sin. It may be that suffering, oppression, and hardship have caused some to become calloused, stiff, and hardened in heart. Ever present are the alluring (and always disappointing) temptations of the world, seeking to draw us away from our first love: Jesus. Whatever the reasons, it is tragic to remain buried beneath a mound of worldly distractions, cynical doubts, idle inactivity, and immature faith when Jesus offers Christian disciples a full and thriving life. Even now, God calls believers to learn about the essence of the spiritual life, to awaken to a vision of spiritual vibrancy, and to renew our commitment to our Savior and Lord. For the seasoned believer and the new convert alike, God invites his people into the vigor and vibrancy of a Christian walk: to keep company with God and his people as we make spiritual progress through spiritual practice.

Spiritual habits are means by which we can experience and enjoy the life-transforming presence of God. Jesus exemplifies a life of spiritual habit, embodying to the fullest extent what it looks like to cultivate a life of communion with God. Amazingly, Jesus experienced a life of formation, growth, and spiritual practice. His model life is an invitation for us to follow in his ways. Throughout generations and cultures, Christian disciples have given themselves to a common core of spiritual disciplines to cultivate their walk with God. Commended throughout the Bible, proven throughout church history, and modeled by the life of Jesus, spiritual disciplines are God’s chosen means for us to enjoy an ongoing relationship with him and to experience transformation in our own lives. Throughout the life of Christ, the Bible illuminates pathways for our faith development.

The account of Jesus’ infancy and youth is recorded in Luke 2:21–52 and it offers a picture of Jesus’ own development and growth. It narrates the devotion of Jesus’ family to follow God’s Law in Jesus’ circumcision and consecration. When Jesus was brought into the temple, Simeon and Anna—both godly and sincere in their faith—celebrated the infant Jesus as the culmination of God’s redemptive plan. Throughout Jesus’ youth, he participated in godly habits of faith formation. During one pilgrimage to Jerusalem, the twelve-year-old Jesus competently engaged religious leaders in the temple about matters of the faith. Throughout Jesus’ infancy and youth, the biblical text clearly depicts Jesus growing and maturing, serving as an example of faith formation and spiritual growth.

Intriguing as this story is to fill in the “gap years” between Jesus’ birth and ministry (which began around age 30), it also helps us understand basic truths related to the life of faith. In this biblical narrative, the Son of God modeled the spiritual life for us. The spiritual climate, spiritual habits, and faith practices that surrounded the early years of Jesus’ life significantly impacted Jesus’ formation and growth. While it is amazing to meditate on the fact that the perfect Son of God grew and developed, it is even more amazing that the process and principles of faith development from Jesus’ life apply to modern believers. While Jesus is different than us in his sinless character and divine nature, Jesus fully shares in our humanity. Consequently, Jesus’ own development instructs us in pathways of spiritual progress. As we explore this record of Jesus’ development—growth that occurred in the context of his family, his faith community, and his own personal life—we attend to our own lives with diligence and prudence to the extent we conform ourselves to his ways.

### A Family Affair: Nurturing Formation at Home

###### Biblical Narrative (Luke 2:21–24)

After Jesus’ birth (2:1–7), angels appeared to shepherds in a field with a message that Jesus, Mary’s newborn baby, was God’s promised deliverer (2:11). Leaving their fields to see baby Jesus with their own eyes, the shepherds went to Bethlehem, found Mary, Joseph, and Jesus, and revealed the angelic message about this baby’s true identity: he is the promised Savior and Messiah (2:8–20). The shepherds responded in worship, and Mary “treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart” (2:19).

In the early years of Jesus’ life, the faith and devotion of Jesus’ family were evident. Eight days after Jesus’ birth, Mary’s new baby, the Messiah, was circumcised and given the name Jesus (2:21; cf. Genesis 17:12; Leviticus 12:3; Luke 1:59; Philippians 3:5). Mary’s naming of Jesus was an act of obedience based upon an earlier angelic instruction. Months earlier, Jesus was the name “the angel had given Him before He had been conceived” (2:21; cf. 1:31). Not only was Jesus’ birth predicted ahead of time, but it was also world-altering when it occurred. Jesus’ name itself speaks of God’s salvation and rescue of sinful humanity. The birth of Jesus Christ was the full embodiment of divine redemption. In Jesus, God’s promises were coming to fruition, and the hopes of humanity were being realized.

After waiting thirty-three more days—“the time of purification” (2:22; cf. Leviticus 12:4)—Mary and Joseph brought Jesus to the temple. The goal of this visit to the temple was to “present [Jesus] to the Lord” (2:22) and to offer a sacrifice for Mary’s purification (2:24; cf. Leviticus 12:6–8). In terms of the dedication of Jesus, the Old Testament Law gave the following command: “Every firstborn male shall be consecrated to the Lord” (2:23; cf. Exodus 13:2). Jesus was not only Mary’s firstborn son (cf. 2:7) but he was also God’s One and Only Son (cf. John 1:14, 18; 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9). Regarding the purification sacrifice, the Law clarified the content of the sacrifice: “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons” (2:24). The option to offer turtledoves or pigeons was a provision in the Law for poorer community members who were unable to afford a lamb as a sacrifice (cf. Leviticus 12:8).

Although Mary and Joseph were of humble means, their devotion to the Lord was noteworthy. Being pious and devoted followers of God, Jesus’ parents obeyed God’s commands. Jesus’ parents did what was “according to the Law of Moses” (2:22), acted “as it is written in the Law of the Lord” (2:23), and offered the sacrifice “specified in the Law of the Lord” (2:24). This obedience to God’s Law reflects their obedience to God’s revelation in the angelic vision (cf. 1:31; 2:20). For Mary and Joseph, God’s revealed word was binding and authoritative. They expressed their faith in God with diligent and undelayed submission to God’s commands.

###### Biblical Principles

_Spiritual Formation in the Family_. The first scene of this narrative focuses on the godliness of Jesus’ family. This holy family’s devotion to God was not for one moment, but it was expressed in an ongoing manner. The faithfulness of Mary (and Joseph) is exhibited prior to Jesus’ birth (1:26–56), at the time of Jesus’ birth (2:11), days after Jesus’ birth (2:21), weeks after Jesus’ birth (2:22–24), on an ongoing yearly basis (2:41), and into the early years of Jesus’ childhood and youth (2:42). Clearly in this passage, Jesus’ mother and adoptive father embraced their role as parents to cultivate a fertile context for faith development. Foundationally, the dutiful and devoted nature of their lifestyle was an exhibition of genuine faith in God. Their punctual and proactive attention to God’s commands was a clear expression of a sincere commitment to God. Their adherence to God’s revealed word established a foundation of allegiance to God and active participation with God’s people. Theirs was _an operative faith_, an authentic trust in God that translated into obedient living and pious practice. Their own devotion to God set the spiritual climate of their home. It was in the context of this God-honoring and spiritually sensitive family that Jesus was reared, nourished, and trained.

Parental devotion to God directly impacts the spiritual development of those in (and outside of) the household. The family is a most important setting for spiritual formation and development. Families incubate spiritual maturity by means of nourishing faith and cultivating godly habits. Inasmuch as Jesus grew up in a home that put its faith into practice, the piety of parents and a general culture of family devotion contribute to the faith formation of others in the family. In God’s design, the household is one of the most formative places to nurture spiritual growth. Siblings, parents, grandparents, and extended relatives occupy a strategic and powerful role of influence in the lives of other family members. Faith, character, and conduct in the home leave enduring marks on those in the household. By God’s grace, a home environment of sincere faith, real devotion, and earnest discipline can build firm foundations of faith for all the members of the household, even impacting those outside of the family unit. In this way, the family is a God-appointed means of directing people toward faithful commitment to God.

_Dedication and Devotion_. The godliness of Jesus’ family was expressed in devotion to God. This devotion manifested itself in many ways in this biblical narrative: circumcision, naming, purification, presentation, and sacrifice. The circumcision of Jesus marked him as a member of God’s people and functioned as a sign of being in covenant relationship with God (2:21). Naming Jesus was an act of obedience to God’s prophetic and authoritative word (2:21; cf. 1:31). It also revealed Jesus’ role as humanity’s Savior (cf. 1:47; 2:11, 30). Obeying God’s instructions on purification was a means to recognize God’s holiness, human uncleanness, and the need for divine cleansing (2:22–23; cf. Leviticus 12:1–8). In presenting Jesus at the temple, Jesus’ parents consecrated and devoted him fully to God (2:22–23). This act of dedication highlights what full surrender to God entails. The offering of a sacrifice to God further reinforced the need for God’s forgiving, purifying, and sanctifying work in the lives of people (2:24).

The dedication of Jesus’ parents depicts wholehearted devotion to God and calls all Christian disciples to the same. Growth in the faith is dependent upon one’s surrender and submission to the Lord. In order to understand the essence of Christian devotion, Jesus’ parents chart a helpful course for us. Marked as members in God’s covenant family, becoming recipients of God’s saving work, recognizing our impure condition, offering ourselves fully to the Lord, and appealing to God for divine cleansing, we embrace devotion in complete submission to God. Spiritual growth does not occur outside of faith commitment to Christ. Casual spirituality does not bear enduring or genuine fruit. In fact, partial and intermittent devotion disrupts spiritual growth. While God certainly does not call us to perfection in our spiritual walk, he does summon us to full surrender.

_Obedience_. Overarching in this narrative is the obedience of Mary and Joseph. Jesus was born to pious parents who followed God’s commands (cf. 2:27). They gave Jesus “the name the angel had given Him” (2:21). They followed God’s revealed word and did “according to the Law of Moses” (2:22), “as it is written in the Law of the Lord” (2:23), and what was “specified in the Law of the Lord” (2:24). Heeding God’s Law and obeying the angelic instructions, Mary and Joseph are models of obedience. Their faith in God resulted in dutifulness toward God’s commands. Devotion to God, galvanized by the faith and habits of a godly family, shapes the lifestyle of believers. Accountable to God, we are all responsible for the way we live our lives. Our lifestyle transforms as we inculcate a life of spiritual discipline and faith habit. These time-tested and God-appointed faith practices help God’s people learn a life of obedience. Christian habits help to bridge the gap between Christian belief and Christian living. The demonstration of this in the life and practice of Jesus’ parents is commended to us as a reliable example to follow.

### The Social Medium: Cultivating Formation in Community

###### Biblical Narrative (Luke 2:25–42)

Mary and Joseph brought Jesus into the temple “to do for Him what was customary under the Law” (2:27). At this time, there was a man named Simeon who also came into the temple. In a way God alone could orchestrate, Simeon was “led by the Spirit” (2:27) to enter the temple, making this meeting with Mary, Joseph, and Jesus possible. Simeon was “righteous and devout” in character and “the Holy Spirit was upon him” (2:25). His faith in God was genuine, and his hope in God was vibrant. A devoted worshiper of God who was “waiting for the consolation of Israel” (2:25), Simeon was longing for God’s redemptive plans to come to fruition. The Holy Spirit made it known to this man of faith that he would not die “before he had seen the Lord’s Christ” (2:26). Confident in God’s promises and eager to experience their fulfillment, Simeon exemplified a life lived in the presence of God.

Simeon’s earnest longing turned into a public demonstration of worship. When Simeon encountered Mary and Joseph, he took baby Jesus into his arms and “blessed God” (2:28). Holding God’s promised Messiah, Simeon recognized that God’s promises for his life and for humanity were coming to fruition. At this moment, Simeon bore witness to God in celebration of Jesus Christ, God’s deliverer sent to rescue his people from sin and condemnation. In an exuberant exclamation of praise, Simeon acknowledged God’s sovereignty and faithfulness (2:29). God had fulfilled his promises, and this meant Simeon was at peace to die. In Jesus, he had seen God’s salvation for all peoples (2:30–32). According to God’s word, Jesus would redeem sinful humanity. God had prepared his salvation “in the sight of all people” (2:31), a salvation that would be available for both Jews and Gentiles (2:32). Divine and ancient promises were fulfilled before Simeon’s very eyes.

Mary and Joseph marveled at what Simeon said (2:33). Simeon blessed them (2:34) and offered a prophetic word to Mary, saying that Jesus was “appointed to cause the rise and fall of many” (2:33). Jesus would be opposed—“spoken against” (2:34)—by the very humanity he came to save. Consequently, Jesus’ coming to earth would not only involve a mission of salvation but also result in a ministry of judgment. He would cause “the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed” (2:35). Even Mary herself would experience hardship and pain—as a sword piercing the soul—around Jesus’ divine vocation (2:35). Some would receive Jesus and enjoy his salvation; others would reject him and bear the consequence of divine judgment. A messianic figure toward which no one can ultimately remain indifferent, Jesus came as the fulfillment of God’s plan of salvation.

At this time, there was an elderly prophetess named Anna in the temple (2:38). She was married for seven years when her husband died. Then, she lived as a widow until she reached eighty-four years of age (2:36–37). Similar to Simeon, she was godly in character and faith. As an archetype of spiritual devotion, she did not leave the temple but remained there and “worshiped night and day, fasting and praying” (2:37). Approaching Jesus, Anna gave thanks to God and spoke about how Jesus was the redemption for which all Israel had been waiting (2:38). After all the expectations for the law had been met, Mary, Joseph, and Jesus returned to their home, Nazareth (2:39). Over the course of time, Jesus “grew and became strong,” “was filled with wisdom,” and “the grace of God was upon Him” (2:40). Part of his growth and development was the regular and consistent devotion of his parents, who made annual trips to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast (2:41–42). In addition to the faithfulness of his parents, Jesus experienced a community of faithful devotion to God.

###### Biblical Principles

_Spiritual Formation in Community_. Jesus not only grew up in a home that meticulously practiced its faith, but he was also part of a community that modeled an earnest desire to follow God’s ways. Simeon and Anna represent the larger faith community of those who lived godly lives, matured in their faith, and devoted themselves to spiritual practices. The righteous character of Simeon (2:25) and the devoted commitment of Anna (2:37) highlight the important role the community can play in character formation and spiritual growth. Their abiding and focused hope in God’s salvation (2:25, 29–32, 38) emphasizes God’s gracious salvation as the foundation of all spiritual growth. Diligent faith practice in the surrounding community reinforced Jesus’ own formation. Much of the biblical record of Jesus’ infancy and youth took place in the temple (2:27, 37; cf. 2:46, 49). Inasmuch as the temple setting represents the presence of God, it also represents the covenant community of God’s people.

Spiritual formation was always intended to be experienced in community. The people we associate ourselves with can either contribute to or derail us from spiritual maturity. As we consider our own progress in the faith, it becomes important for us to embed ourselves in the faith community with active participation and purposeful engagement. In the community of faith, there are mentors to guide us, leaders to instruct us, and companions to grow along with us as we practice God’s presence. The church as a community of spiritual practice is God’s pre-appointed social medium to aid us in spiritual growth.

_Spiritual Practices_. Jesus’ parents acted according to “what was customary under the Law” (2:27), “everything required by the Law” (2:39), and “the custom of the Feast” (2:42). This was not only an act of obedience, but a focused commitment to practice the faith with care and regularity. Their life of obedience grew out of disciplined and directed spiritual practice, giving themselves to the cultivation of God-honoring habits. Spiritual community and faith tradition resulted in a transformation of lifestyle as they encourage disciples to engage in the life of faith with spiritual practices. Spiritual practices can serve as a helpful bridge by which genuine belief is translated into godly conduct.

There are many different kinds of spiritual practices. Consider the diverse list of practices, customs, and ceremonies that appear in this short episode of Jesus’ early life. Mary and Joseph performed rites of circumcision, naming, dedication, and presentation soon after Jesus’ birth (2:21–22). Jesus’ parents practiced stewardship (according to their means) by offering a sacrifice to God (2:24). Mary modeled meditation and contemplation when she “treasured up all these things in her heart” (2:51; cf. 2:19). Simeon expressed himself in worship and praise of God (2:28; cf. 2:13–14, 20 where the angels and shepherds responded to Jesus’ in worship). Anna expressed her trust and devotion to God with acts of fasting and prayer. She anticipated the coming of the Messiah with full dependence upon God (2:37). Anna practiced gratitude and confession when she met the Christ child (2:38). Jesus’ family went on special (2:22, 39) and regular (2:41–42) pilgrimage to Jerusalem. In the temple, youthful Jesus engaged in impressive dialogue and teaching (2:46–47). The panoply of spiritual practices in this short biblical narrative helps us see the important role of spiritual habits in faith maturity as we practice the presence of God in our daily lives.

_Presence of God_. Disciples experience life transformation in the presence of God. God himself is the source of salvation and spiritual growth. On our own, we cannot come to faith in Christ or grow in our devotion to God. God’s gracious, sovereign, and powerful intervention is the foundation of all spiritual growth. In this story and for the people of Israel, the temple represents God’s presence with his people (2:27, 37; cf. 2:46, 49). The temple was God’s orchestrated means for his people to enter into his presence: a holy rendezvous of God and his covenant people. Simeon and Anna both represent lives constantly lived in the presence of God. Simeon was identified as a man who was led by the Spirit (2:25–27). Ana served God as a “prophetess” (2:36) and “never left the temple, but worshiped night and day” (2:37). Both of these historical figures expressed praise to God (2:28, 37) and trusted God to fulfill his prophetic word (2:26, 29, 34). Jesus’ temple-centric upbringing afforded a spiritual climate for the youthful Jesus to cultivate his own life in the presence of God the Father.

In general, the journey of faith is a life of spiritual practice and faith habit that helps disciples live consciously and constantly in the presence of God. Spiritual practices—worship, prayer, fasting, and the like—assist us in abiding in God’s presence. Abiding in God’s presence is crucial because only God can bring about life transformation in his people. When we enter God’s presence, surrender to his word, experience his intervention in the world, and encounter his work in our lives, we are in a spiritual context where dynamic and lasting life change can occur. In short, cultivating the spiritual life is a matter of abiding in the transforming presence of God. It was here that Simeon and Anna embraced their divine calling, cultivated godly character, and grew in spiritual practice. For us, it is also the presence of God that results in our life change. The presence of God is overwhelming and overpowering for those alienated from and opposed to God (2:34–35). For those who have genuine faith in Christ, God’s presence is the source of enduring faith, the fullness of our good, the mainstay of daily life, and the hopeful means for spiritual maturity.

### (Not Really) Left Behind: Focusing on Formation with Yourself

###### Biblical Narrative (Luke 2:41–52)

Following the tradition of the Jewish faith, Jesus and his parents traveled on a religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the Passover Feast. It was something they did “every year” (2:41) and “according to the custom of the Feast” (2:42). When Jesus was twelve years of age, his family made this same trip to Jerusalem. At the end of the feast, “the boy Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem” (2:43). When Jesus’ parents started their trek back home, they left without the youthful Jesus. Jesus’ parents “were unaware He had stayed” (2:43). Thinking that Jesus was with the caravan of people returning home, they left the city and traveled a day’s journey before they realized that Jesus was missing (2:44). At this point, they began to “look for Him among their relatives and friends” (2:44). When they were unable to find him among the company of travelers, they went back to Jerusalem to look for him (2:44–45).

Only three days later did they find Jesus. Amazingly, he was in the temple. He was sitting with the religious teachers, “listening to them and asking questions” (2:46). In the course of this religious conversation, Jesus was not only asking questions but also offering answers. Witnesses of this faith-based discussion were stirred to wonder. Those who heard Jesus “were astounded at His understanding and His answers” (2:47). Youthful Jesus was not just competent to dialogue with other _Jewish adults_; he was engaged in conversation with _religious teachers_. In this scene, Jesus’ spiritual maturity, theological understanding, and rhetorical skill were evident for all to see.

When Jesus’ parents saw their son in the temple courts, they were also astonished at what was taking place. The immediate amazement of the moment, combined with the intense anxiety of not knowing where Jesus was, caused Mary to express her panic to her twelve-year-old son. Mary asked Jesus, “Child, why have You done this to us?” (2:48). She explained to Jesus, “Your father and I have been anxiously searching for You” (2:48). Jesus responded with two pointed and probing questions: “Why were you looking for Me?” and “Did you not know that I had to be in My Father’s house?” (2:49). The first question challenged their anxiety and worry. The second question confronted their lack of understanding concerning faith priorities. While the question posed by Jesus’ parents revealed their own anxiety and distress, Jesus’ two questions pressed his parents to evaluate their spiritual understanding of Jesus’ identity and devotion.

Although Jesus’ parents were genuinely concerned for the welfare of their son, Jesus’ questions emphasized that his relationship with God the Father established the foundation of all other life priorities, values, and relationships. Jesus’ parents did not fully understand the meaning of Jesus’ reply (2:50). Nevertheless, Jesus submitted to his parents’ wishes—he “was obedient to them” (2:51)—and returned home with them to Nazareth. Just like her response when the shepherds visited Jesus at his birth (2:19), Mary once again “treasured up all these things in her heart” (2:51). After this extended pilgrimage to the temple, the narrative record states that “Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man” (2:52; cf. 2:40). Jesus grew and developed within a context where spiritual practice, faith habit, and godly discipline were a regular part of his individual, family, and community upbringing.

###### Biblical Principles

_Spiritual Formation in Personal Development_. Jesus not only enjoyed the formative influence of his family and his surrounding community, but he also took responsibility for his own spiritual progress. Jesus’ growth in life and faith (2:40, 52) is evident in this passage. The final temple scene in this narrative highlights Jesus’ competency to impressively discuss faith matters with religious teachers (2:46–48). Jesus’ response to his parents also emphasizes the priority of his relationship with God the Father (2:49). The fact that Jesus prioritized his relationship with God and simultaneously obeyed his parents (2:51) reinforces the importance of spiritual maturity in all spheres of life. Jesus modeled a perfect balance of devotion to God and responsibility to people without being delinquent in either realm. Jesus’ faithfulness was related to his mature spiritual understanding. Twelve years of age, Jesus not only had a robust theological knowledge (2:47) but also a mature grasp of his identity and vocation (2:49–50). This unique story of Jesus’ early years depicts the youthful Jesus as responsible, dutiful, learned, and wise in all matters of life and devotion.

The Bible persuasively commends Jesus’ example to us. However important the influences of our family and community, each person must take responsibility for his life of faith. At the end of time, each person will stand answerable before God for the way he lived (and did not live) his life. Jesus lived with a consciousness of his relationship with God and embraced his lifework as a divine assignment given to him by God the Father. Jesus’ own development was fostered by his devotion to his life purpose. In a similar way, our personal development is a means by which we can realize our God-given purpose in life. Faith formation and spiritual maturity modeled in the life of Jesus should offer us a vision of Christian maturity, a call to faithfulness in the Christian walk, and an apologetic for employing spiritual practices in the journey of faith.

_The Christian Life as Faith Pilgrimage_. Spiritual practices guide us in our journey of faith. A biblical narrative that highlights Jesus’ growth and development, this historical account is set in the context of a religious pilgrimage to Jerusalem (2:22, 39, 41–45). Jesus’ parents made a special trip to Jerusalem for the time of consecration and purification (2:22). Throughout Jesus’ youth, his parents brought him to Jerusalem every year to celebrate Passover (2:41–42). Inasmuch as the temple represented the presence of God, the practice of pilgrimage depicts the life of faith as a spiritual journey. Sometimes the journey of faith makes our life itinerant, causing us to follow God in mission journeys and spiritual retreats. Overall, the life of faith should be viewed as an ongoing journey of following Christ in the presence of God. The metaphor of spiritual pilgrimage is a helpful image that speaks about the important dynamics of being a follower of Christ.

Traveling on pilgrimage (which can be a spiritual practice in and of itself) is a constant reminder that spiritual formation is a process. The nature of the Christian life involves following God’s lead through the terrain of our earthly existence. Awaiting us at the end of our faith pilgrimage is not an earthly Jerusalem or a perishable temple but a lasting city and uninterrupted fellowship in the presence of God. Companionship in the journey is hugely important. We should take great care to wisely consider those with whom we travel, recognizing that co-travelers in life’s journey—friends, spouses, coworkers, communities, and churches—influence us in immeasurable ways. Along the way, spiritual disciplines enable us to progress in the pilgrimage of faith, building spiritual stamina for the journey of faithful discipleship. On a journey of faith, spiritual practices serve as devices to mark the milestones of the journey, redirect us when we wander off the path, build endurance in long-suffering, encourage a sense of anticipation, and keep our attention focused on the final destination.

_Wonder, Mystery, and Contemplation_. Spiritual practices also help to stir and stimulate wonder in our lives. In the setting of this story, Jesus’ life aroused amazement (2:33, 47, 48, 51). When the shepherds revealed the true identity of Jesus, “all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them” (2:18). Hearing Simeon’s testimony about baby Jesus, Jesus’ parents “were amazed at what was spoken about Him” (2:33). In a similar way, when Jesus dialogued with the teachers in the temple, “all who heard Him were astounded at His understanding and His answers” (2:47). When Jesus’ parents saw him in the temple, once again they “were astonished” (2:48). The extraordinary nature of Jesus’ identity and vocation caused Mary to treasure up these realities in her heart (2:19, 51). The exceptionality of Jesus was evident to those around him and evoked marvel and wonder. This does not mean that everyone at the time fully understood who Jesus was and why he had come to earth. In the temple courts, Jesus’ parents did not even comprehend his statements about spiritual priority and his relationship with God the Father (2:50). Nevertheless, in the process of ongoing faith maturity, one should expect an increasing sense of wonder and astonishment toward Jesus, an awe and admiration that draws us more and more toward God and encourages us to increasingly abide in God’s presence.

The Christian life involves wonder at Jesus’ exceptionality, silence over faith’s mysteries, and contemplation about spiritual realities. Spiritual disciplines assist God’s people to encounter the wonders of the Christian faith in ordinary life. Whether prayer, Scripture reading, silence, Sabbath, retreat, or fasting, the historically practiced disciplines of the faith enable us to realize Jesus’ incomparability and uniqueness. Truly, Jesus is the one and only Son of God who warrants our complete and exclusive devotion. After twelve years of raising Jesus in their household, it could have become easy for Mary to view Jesus just like every other child. He was their “normal” reality, which could easily have stifled wonder and bred overfamiliarity. What could have happened to Jesus’ parents regularly happens to us. It was both Jesus’ _ordinary_ and _exceptional_ nature that evoked wonder. He grew and matured like other children, but attained a distinct spiritual maturity. He was born into the world through normal biological processes but was conceived through divine intervention. He was nurtured by his parents, yet would one day save humanity. He participated in the religious life of his community, yet confounded Jewish teachers in his youth. He is fully human and fully God at the same time. Spiritual practices enable God’s people to deeply contemplate and powerfully encounter Jesus—the God-Man—in life-transforming ways.

_Progress in the Faith_. Formation in the Christian life is a journey marked by milestones and seasons. Growth occurs in phases, and development takes place in stages. In this biblical narrative, we see Jesus described by various developmental terms: baby (2:16), child (2:17, 27, 34, 40), boy (2:43), and man (3:23). From a newborn baby to a thirty-year-old man, Jesus matured into adulthood. This growth was more than mere biological maturation. After Jesus’ temple dedication, we are told that Jesus “grew and became strong” and he was “filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon Him” (2:40). At the end of the narrative, Luke records that Jesus grew in “wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man” (2:52). Jesus grew in body, wisdom, relationship, and spiritual devotion.

As we make progress in our journey of faith, we advance from one developmental stage to the next. Spiritual practices help us progress in the faith. Spiritual habits help us grow in each of these phases and also help us transition from one stage to the next. The time-tested habits of the Christian life are crucial practices that aid us in making progress in our pilgrimage of faith and mark where we are in our spiritual journey. Like bridges, faith habits and Christian disciplines assist us in connecting what we believe to how we live. Faithful and sincere spiritual practice enables us to internalize truth into our hearts. As many of the spiritual practices help us embody our faith, the disciplines of the Christian life help us to promote a holistic approach to spirituality: engaging mind, body, heart, and relationship in an integrated walk with God. If the perfect Son of God experienced growth and development during his earthly life and ministry, so should we attend to our own progress in the faith.

### Conclusion

Jesus is the only means of salvation and the ultimate example of spiritual maturity. Jesus was born into a family that faithfully followed God’s ways, providing a nurturing environment for his development and growth. While Jesus’ parents exemplify the importance of a godly family, Anna and Simeon represent the importance of a supportive faith community. When Jesus turned twelve, his skillful dialogue with the religious leaders showcased his own prioritized (and prioritizing) devotion to God the Father. Although Jesus is fully God, completely sinless, and wholly perfect, he still grew, developed, and matured. Importantly, his own development occurred in the context of personal devotion, family piety, and mature community. Spiritual practices and faith habits served this development in vital ways.

Jesus’ life is an example of spiritual maturity and faith progress. Helpful to all disciples in all cultures and throughout all generations, the biblical narrative of Jesus’ development and growth guides us in our own journey of the spiritual life. Jesus’ life is an encouragement as well as an instruction. Jesus is the pioneer of our faith in both _achieving salvation_ and _demonstrating devotion_. As God designed it, cultivating the life of faith requires us to embrace life as a faith pilgrimage, employ spiritual practices, abide in God’s presence, and foster devotion in all spheres of life. In the end, while we depend upon God’s grace for our new birth, we also cling to it as the only hopeful means for our ongoing life transformation.

| **Spiritual Practice**                 | In this passage, Jesus models <em>the importance of spiritual practice in faith formation</em>. Jesus grew up in a household and covenant community devoted to God. This created a God-honoring context for Jesus’ formation and development. These dynamics are seen during Jesus’ birth, infancy, and youth. His circumcision after birth, his presentation at the temple, and his dialogue with religious teachers help show Jesus as a model for Christian living and spiritual practice. A summary of this story’s principles is outlined below. |
| **Spiritual Formation**                | God calls Jesus’ disciples to grow in their faith (2:40, 52). Spiritual growth is a spiritual journey (2:22, 39, 41–45). It is also a process of growth that takes place over time and in stages. Jesus himself grew in these stages: baby (2:16), child (2:17, 27, 34, 40), boy (2:43), and man (3:23). Christ-centered spiritual formation is meant to be experienced in Christian community.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Life Spheres**                       | Jesus’ growth and development took place in the context of all spheres of life: family devotion (2:21–24, 39–42), godly community (2:22–39, 41–51), and personal development (2:40, 52)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Growth Domains**                     | Jesus grew and developed in all areas of life: intellectual, physical, relational, and spiritual (2:40, 52).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Spiritual Practices**                | Spiritual practices are fundamental to the Christian life (2:27, 39, 42). They establish new habits in the life of faith and help translate Christian belief into obedience. Some of the practices that occur in this story are: special rites (2:21–22), stewardship of resources (2:24), contemplation (2:51; cf. 2:19), praise (2:28, 37; cf. 2:13–14, 20), fasting and prayer (2:37), (2:38), special pilgrimage (2:22, 39, 41–42), teaching (2:46–47), and community worship (2:41–42, 46–49).                                                   |
| **Living in the Presence of God**      | In this story, the setting of the temple shows the importance of devotion to God and the role of the Christian community (2:22–38, 41–51). To be in the temple is to be in God’s presence (2:25–28, 37, 46, 49). The Christian life is to be lived daily in the presence of God.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Foundations of Christian Formation** | Spiritual growth is dependent upon a commitment to God expressed in a life of faith (2:25, 38), worship (2:28, 37, 2:13–14, 20), devotion (2:22–25, 37), obedience (2:21–22, 24, 27), and wonder (2:19, 33, 47, 48, 51).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Jesus Christ as Savior and Example** | Jesus not only accomplished salvation for sinners (2:25–26, 30–35, 38), but he also modeled Christian living and spiritual growth (2:40, 52).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
