## Introduction

> Why spend money on that which is not bread, and your labor on that which does not satisfy? Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good, and your soul will delight in the richest of foods. Isaiah 55:2

> Obedience is the only reality. It is faith visible, faith acting, and faith manifest. It is the test of real discipleship among the Lord’s people. J. C. Ryle, _Wheat or Chaff?_

God is calling us to the best possible life! His plan for such a life is a summons to faithful obedience. Although we enter into a relationship with God by faith alone, genuine faith in Christ yields the blessed fruit of obedience. Set free by the gospel of Christ, God shapes his followers into the likeness of Jesus to live a life of godliness and righteousness. Profoundly, the power of the gospel has set us free to obey God. Rather than following God’s commands, people try to find “the good life” in many different ways. Some run to money, possessions, and wealth to satisfy their inner longings. Others chase the endless chants of pleasures and amusements in hopes of filling their hearts’ desires. Pressured under the weight of suffering or pain, others look for any possible escape or cheap distraction. They believe that the next fix, the next fad, or the next diversion can alleviate the stresses of life. Still others seek after power, coveting control over the lives of others.

Despite these countless and vain efforts to secure the good life, we know that each of these routes leads us down a dead-end street. Pleasures dry up. Power gets the best of us. Possessions are incapable of filling our hearts’ longings. Amusing escapes are all too short-lived. On the contrary, the disciple of Christ has denied self, rejected the devil, and forsaken the world’s offerings to find fulfillment and joy in God alone. Having come to faith in Christ, we must reroute our lives toward God’s ways—reorienting our desires after righteousness, revamping our habits to form new life rhythms, and retraining our minds to a whole new way of thinking. In short, the blessings of God are discovered in the path of faithful devotion to God.

The Scriptures highlight faithful obedience through the life of a godly woman named Ruth. This story is recorded in Ruth 1:1–4:22. Through the life of this poor, young, and widowed migrant, we not only see the life of obedience modeled, but we also witness God’s work of redemption gloriously displayed. Ruth, a great exemplar of the faith, lived in difficult and dangerous circumstances. She faced the threat of violence and the grueling devastation of famine. Living in Moab, Ruth and her mother-in-law, Naomi, personally felt the sting of death, losing multiple members of their family. When Ruth returned with Naomi to Bethlehem, she lived a life of devotion to God. In God’s providence, the family’s situation changed when Boaz, a kinsman-redeemer, married Ruth and took the family under his protective care. Certainly, Ruth and Naomi were familiar with suffering, heartache, struggle, and grief. In the course of her life, Ruth demonstrated faithful obedience, embodied godly character, and (most of all) enjoyed gracious redemption.

Like Ruth and Naomi, God roots the identity of his people in his gracious work of redemption. Ruth’s story is a powerful journey of an unseemly woman who found the best possible life. Amazingly, her humble life of devotion allowed her to become a vital part of God’s cosmic plan for all human civilization. In her story, we see a picture of a blessed life. Ruth enjoyed the freedom of God’s merciful redemption, entrusted herself to God’s safekeeping, and followed God’s commands in joy-filled obedience. Amazingly, this young, poor, and displaced widow can teach us how the life of faith leads us to a blessed life of obedience. Let’s prayerfully enter into her story as a means to bring our own lives into greater alignment with God!

### Biblical Commentary

Read the following commentary of the biblical passage. Use this explanation to help gain a better understanding of the biblical narrative and important biblical principles that the passage teaches.

#### Passage Introduction

##### Key Idea

Obedience to God is the path of blessing.

##### Passage Overview

As we have learned, obedience is God’s plan for the best possible life. Importantly, only God’s gracious redemption makes the life of obedience possible. In reality, there are only two ways to live your life: the world’s way or God’s way. On the one hand, following the way of the world will ultimately lead you down a path of destruction. On the other hand, following God’s way puts you on the path of life. In the rush of life, many of us do not take the time to assess which path we are on. Ruth’s story is instructive for us. The record of her loss and pain helps us process our own suffering with honesty and candor. Her faithful devotion to God (and Naomi) summons us to a life of complete commitment to Christ. The redemption she experienced in Boaz is ultimately fulfilled in Christ’s redemption, reminding us that faith in Christ is the beginning of all that is truly life. Under the coverage of God’s covenant care, we enjoy blessing and fullness as we align our lives with God’s ways. Consider the details in the following commentary to help you understand Ruth’s story and how she is an exemplar of faith and devotion to God.

#### **A Life of Devotion to God**

> Show me Your ways, O Lord; teach me Your paths. Guide me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation; all day long I wait for You. Psalm 25:4–5

> There are two ways, one of life and one of death; but a great difference between the two ways. _Didache_

##### Introduction

Devotion to God is a journey toward the best possible life. Genuine devotion to God bears the fruit of submission and obedience to God. In turn, faithful obedience to God puts us on the path of God’s blessing. This does not suggest that following God’s commands guarantees a life of wealth, privilege, or ease. It also does not mean that humans can earn God’s favor by exemplary moral conduct. No person has the capacity to obey God’s commands in his own strength. God’s commands represent the essence of God’s righteous and holy character, and God’s character determines all that is best in life. Not only is God worthy of our complete obedience, but a full and satisfying life is a byproduct of unreserved devotion to God. The beginning of godly living is sincere faith—loving devotion to God in all areas of life. Rather than merely studying godliness in abstract terms, we turn to the Scripture to discover a concrete example of a faithful life that enjoyed God’s blessing even in the midst of incredible hardship.

In Ruth 1:1–4:22, we read the historical account of a godly Moabite woman who displayed sincere faith, courageous obedience, and godly character amid challenging circumstances. The story begins by recounting the horrific loss experienced by Naomi and her daughter-in-law, Ruth, during a lengthy sojourn in Moab. Despite this loss, Ruth showed faithful devotion to God in her care for Naomi. Ruth returned with Naomi to Bethlehem, where she diligently served her family by gleaning in the fields. Because of God’s sovereign kindness, Ruth gleaned in the fields of a family relative named Boaz. Eventually, this godly benefactor redeemed (as a kinsman-redeemer) Ruth by marrying her. In this act of godliness, Ruth and Naomi enjoyed a complete reversal of their desperate situation. Ruth gave birth to a child, who formed the lineage of Jesus Christ, the ultimate Redeemer of humanity.

The story of Ruth is a powerful narrative of a noble and courageous woman who, against all odds, obeyed God in faithful obedience. Her faithfulness and obedience resulted in a life that embodied godly character. Through painful loss, Ruth came to enjoy God’s promised blessing. Despite cynical naysayers and violent surroundings, she exhibited undeviating and sacrificial devotion. Regardless of terrifying obstacles, looming danger, and improbable circumstances, she refused to abandon her dedication to an upright life. And, well aware of her own weakness and need, she came to find God’s favor, rescue, and redemption. In all this, she remained steadfast and loyal in her commitment to God, God’s ways, God’s people, and God’s mission in the world. In many ways, Ruth is an exemplar of the faith: confident in trust, noble in character, and constant in obedience. For this reason, we now sit teachably at her feet, hoping that the light of her example might shine brightly around us, illuminating our way ahead in our journey of faith.

##### Brought Back Empty: Enduring the Pain of Tragic Loss

###### Biblical Narrative (Ruth 1:1–22)

In the opening scene, we meet a woman named Naomi (1:2) who had been battered and bruised by great hardship. In fast succession, we observe this woman inundated by a tsunami of difficulty, one crisis mounting upon another. Naomi was living “in the days when the judges ruled” (1:1). Notably, this era of the judges was an unstable time of war, conflict, and violence. In addition to social instability, Israel experienced great moral decline, with people living lives marked by idolatry, injustice, immorality, and spiritual infidelity. It was an unnerving time to live. Additionally, at this point in Naomi’s life, there was “a famine in the land” (1:1; cf. 1:6). The scarcity of food would have put extreme pressure on families to find daily provisions, constraining them to a mode of survival living. Consequently, Naomi and her husband Elimelech (1:2) “went to reside in the land of Moab” (1:1; cf. 1:2). “Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah,” this family “entered the land of Moab and settled there” (1:2). Displaced from their homeland, they were living the life of exiles, foreigners in a land not their home. Then, personal tragedy struck. At some point during their time in Moab, “Naomi’s husband Elimelech died, and she was left with her two sons” (1:3). Adding deeper pain to unspeakable misery, after about ten years (1:4), we read about the tragedy that struck her two sons: “both Mahlon and Chilion also died” (1:5). At this point, the narrator emphasizes Naomi’s unfortunate circumstances by leaving her nameless. The Hebrew text simply states that the woman “was left without her two sons and without her husband” (1:5). All that remained were the two foreign wives—Orpah and Ruth—that her sons had married during their time in Moab (1:4).

Sometime later, having learned that the famine was over in her homeland, bereaved Naomi planned to return to Israel. She had “heard in Moab that the Lord had attended to His people by providing them with food” (1:6). Therefore, Naomi and her two daughters-in-law “left the place where she had been living and set out on the road leading back to the land of Judah” (1:7). Naomi must have felt helpless and powerless to provide adequate care for Orpah and Ruth. Even more, these women would serve as constant reminders of her great loss in Moab. Destitute and desolate, Naomi encouraged her two daughters-in-law to “go back” to their families in Moab (1:8). Naomi pronounced blessings on them: “May the Lord show you loving devotion, as you have shown to your dead and to me” (1:8) and “May the Lord enable each of you to find rest in the home of your new husband” (1:9). After Naomi kissed her daughters-in-law—the shriveled remains of a once full family—the shared pain and collective grief exploded into tears and “they wept aloud” (1:9; cf. 1:14).

Demonstrating their faithfulness to Naomi, Orpah and Ruth refused to abandon their mother-in-law in her desperate time of need. They expressed their commitment to Naomi, “Surely we will return with you to your people” (1:10). Naomi countered their response, telling them to “return home” (1:11). Naomi explained that she had nothing to offer them. She had no sons for them to marry, she had no husband to give her sons, and she was too old to bear more sons for them (1:11–13). And, even if Naomi could bear children, Orpah and Ruth would have to wait for these sons to grow up to marry them (1:12–13). Tragedy had struck deadly blows against Naomi, and this grieving woman felt like the surviving remains of a catastrophe. Essentially, Naomi was all that was “left” (1:3, 5) in a string of personal tragedies and excruciating losses. Like rubble and debris—only shreds of an old life—her life was a mere shadow of its former state. Close to declaring bankruptcy on life, Naomi was on the brink of despair, refusing to believe that “there was hope” (1:12).

In response, the threesome of widows “wept aloud” (1:14). At this time, “Orpah kissed her mother-in-law goodbye, but Ruth clung to her” (1:14). Even though Naomi urged Ruth to follow Orpah home (1:15), Ruth responded with a pledge of devotion: “For wherever you go, I will go, and wherever you live, I will live; your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord punish me, and ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me” (1:16–17). Ruth expressed her commitment to Naomi as a commitment to Naomi’s God. Because “Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped trying to persuade her” (1:18).

Eventually, Naomi and Ruth “came to Bethlehem” (1:19). As Naomi returned to the home she had left many years ago, the best way she could describe her situation was bitter and empty. Unable to forget her immense grief (1:13), Naomi rebuked the townspeople who questioned if she was really Naomi: “Do not call me Naomi … Call me Mara, because the Almighty has dealt quite bitterly with me” (1:20). Her bitterness was compounded by her feeling of emptiness: “I went away full, but the Lord has brought me back empty” (1:21; cf. 3:17). And if her bitterness and emptiness were not enough, she felt as if God was her adversary: “the hand of the Lord has gone out against me” (1:13), “the Almighty has dealt quite bitterly with me” (1:20), “the Lord has brought me back empty” (1:21), “the Lord has testified against me” (1:21), and “the Almighty has afflicted me” (1:21). She felt the crushing weight of what seemed to be divine disfavor. The magnitude of her loss was so great that “the whole city was stirred” (1:19) by news of her tragedy. Her reputation had been soiled, and now she bore the shame as a woman of loss.

###### Biblical Principles

_Loss and Tragedy_. Ruth and Naomi experienced great difficulty. Not only enduring sociopolitical instability and famine (1:1), Naomi and her husband also lived as exiles in a foreign land (1:1, 2). The mixed Israelite-Moabite family that was formed during this exile was struck by sudden and tragic loss: the death of sons and husbands (1:3–5). The feeling of being “left without” is an apt description for such a kind of lonely bereavement (1:5). The string of tragedies caused great emotional sorrow: loud weeping (1:9, 14) and grief (1:13). A feeling of hopelessness (1:12) and social shame (1:19–20) seemed to cement her fate as bitter (1:20), empty (1:21), afflicted (1:21), and attacked by God (1:13, 21). Circumstances that would devastate most, Ruth and Naomi experienced things that make up the substance of our greatest fears and nightmares.

Our lives can be characterized in similar ways to the experience of Ruth and Naomi: bitter, lonely, empty, grieving, disheartened, ashamed, beaten down, and burned out. Passing through painful ordeals can make us feel like a shadow of our former selves. In these instances of loss and pain, hopelessness and despair, and grief and sorrow, we can feel like God has stretched out his hand against us. Surprisingly, Ruth’s sterling example of faith and obedience was born out of a veritable wreckage of loss and tragedy. As exemplified by this heroine's life, faithful devotion did not come out of ease, comfort, or convenience; rather, it was forged on the anvil of suffering. Amazingly, what seemed like the worst possible life became fertile ground for the best possible life. Although an unlikely starting point, acute suffering is a common context from which Christ’s disciples experience the good life—blessing that comes from faithful commitment and godly living in the face of grave hardship.

_Devotion and Commitment_. Amid tragedy and loss, Ruth displayed inspiring faith commitment. Refusing to return home to the familiar security of Moab, Ruth expressed her commitment to Naomi by joining her on the trek back to Bethlehem (1:10). This was both a commitment to Naomi and “[her] people” (1:10; cf. 1:16). Ruth clinging to Naomi (1:14) visibly enacted her determination to travel with Naomi (1:18). Ruth’s commitment to Naomi and her people fundamentally involved a commitment to God: “your God will be my God” (1:16 cf. 1:15). Ruth obligated herself to this commitment by expressly confessing her accountability to God: “May the Lord punish me, and ever so severely, if anything but death separates you and me” (1:17). As such, the commitment was a whole life commitment: “wherever you go, I will go” (1:16), “and wherever you live, I will live” (1:16), “where you die, I will die” (1:17). Ruth’s commitment to God was expressed in the “loving devotion” (1:8; cf. 2:20; 3:10)—an unrelenting commitment of a covenant relationship—she had shown to others. Whereas Naomi urged Ruth to return to Moab in order to find God’s “loving devotion” (1:8)—and along with it the hope of “rest” and a “home” (1:9)—Ruth discovered the fullness of life in serving the God of Naomi.

Modeled in the life of Ruth, godly living is an outgrowth of love for God and love for others. Devotion and commitment to God involve a whole-life commitment, a complete surrender to serve God regardless of the consequences. Godly Christians do not determine how they live based on surrounding circumstances or popular opinion. Believers do not adjust their lifestyles to suit the fashions and fads of culture. Disciples are not driven to please the unreliable and ever-changing opinions of men. Instead, the values of the Christian life are genuine expressions of a full and faithful allegiance to God. Like Ruth, a fitting way to describe such allegiance is by the term “loving devotion” (1:8). The experience of suffering has a unique way of exposing the objects of our loving devotion. Even more, loving devotion to God enables us to have a completely different manner in which we endure our present suffering. Amazingly, a life of godly devotion is a pathway for divine favor, blessing showered upon us regardless of our circumstances and in the face of painful suffering.

##### A Rich Reward: Enjoying the Blessing of Faithful Obedience

###### Biblical Narrative (Ruth 2:1–23)

Now residents of Bethlehem, Naomi and Ruth needed to make a life for themselves. Upon her initiative, Ruth asked Naomi for permission to “go into the fields and glean heads of grain” (2:2). A provision for the poor, the act of gleaning involved needy people gathering left-over portions of a harvest. Ruth had hoped she would glean “after someone in whose sight [she] may find favor” (2:2). Naomi gave Ruth permission (2:2–3). In God’s providence, “Naomi had a relative on her husband’s side, a prominent man of noble character from the clan of Elimelech” (2:1). The man’s name was Boaz (2:1) and when Ruth went to glean, “she happened to come to the part of the field belonging to Boaz” (2:3). At the time Ruth was gleaning grain—“just then” (2:4)— Boaz arrived. A man of faith, Boaz greeted his harvesters in an honorable and reverent manner, “The Lord be with you” (2:4). After the harvesters returned a blessing upon their patron and employer (2:4), Boaz asked about the “young woman” gleaning in the field (2:5). The foreman told Boaz that “she is the Moabitess who returned with Naomi from the land of Moab” (2:6). Giving testimony about her character and work ethic, the foreman told Boaz how she asked permission to glean in the field and had “continued from morning until now, except that she rested a short time in the shelter” (2:7).

Boaz was impressed by this young Moabite woman. Consequently, he told Ruth to remain in his field to glean, to “not go away from this place” (2:8). Providing for her a place among a community of harvesters, Boaz told Ruth to gather grain close by to his servant girls (2:8–9). Boaz also secured her safety when he “ordered the young men not to touch [her]” (2:9). In fact, the godly patron gave Ruth permission to nourish herself as needed: “when you are thirsty, go and drink from the jars the young men have filled” (2:9). The favor that Ruth had earlier sought (2:2) had been discovered in the magnanimous benefactor, Boaz. Showing honor and gratitude to her new champion, Ruth “fell on her face, bowing low to the ground” (2:10). She expressed amazement that Boaz would show her “such favor” to “take notice” of her, especially since she was “a foreigner” (2:10). Recounting her record of faithful devotion, Boaz told Ruth that he had heard about her sacrificial commitment to Naomi (2:11). Then, Boaz pronounced a blessing on her, asking God to show Ruth blessing and protection: “May the Lord repay your work, and may you receive a rich reward from the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have taken refuge” (2:12). Ruth accepted this blessing and expressed her desire to find Boaz’s continued favor (2:13).

Indeed, Boaz continued to treat Ruth favorably. When it was time to eat, the benevolent patron invited Ruth to eat “beside the harvesters” (2:14). The woman working the edge of the fields was now a main participant in the meal. Poverty had turned to privilege. Marginalization had given way to acceptance and provision. She not only ate “roasted grain,” but she “was satisfied and had some left over” (2:14). Eventually, Ruth returned to her work of gathering sheaves. When this happened, Boaz “ordered his young men” to “not insult her” even if she gathered “among the sheaves” (2:15). Even more, he told his servants to pull out stalks that had already been gathered and leave them for Ruth to gather (2:16). As they did this, Boaz gave them strict orders to “not rebuke her” (2:16).

An industrious and virtuous woman, Ruth continued her work “until evening” and gathered “about an ephah of barley” (2:17). Ruth brought home the grain and the leftovers from the meal (2:18). Impressed with the provisions of the day, Naomi asked where she worked (2:19) and Ruth informed her that she gleaned at Boaz’s field (2:19). Recognizing all that this benefactor had done for their family, Naomi spoke a blessing over Boaz: “May he be blessed by the Lord, who has not withdrawn His kindness from the living or the dead” (2:20). Then, Naomi informed Ruth that Boaz “is a close relative” and “is one of our kinsman-redeemers” (2:20). According to the Jewish law, a kinsman-redeemer is close kin who is legally able (and responsible; see Deuteronomy 25:5–10) to marry a widowed family member in order to provide for them. Ruth told Naomi that Boaz instructed her to continue gleaning in his field until the end of the harvest (2:21). Naomi encouraged Ruth to remain working in Boaz’s field “so that nothing will happen to you in another field” (2:22). Ruth obeyed the instructions of Boaz and Naomi.

###### Biblical Principles

_Faith-Filled Devotion_. Surrounded by tragedy and suffering, Ruth arose as a faith exemplar. She is not only a heroine in this story and a paragon in biblical history; she is also a model for contemporary disciples. Asking Naomi permission to glean in the fields, Ruth exemplified respect for her mother-in-law and personal initiative in her work (2:2). Meek and lowly, Ruth realized that she needed favor (2:2). After all, she was a poor widowed foreigner (2:2, 10, 11) who was “not like one of [the] servant girls” (2:13). Ruth understood herself to be a servant (2:13; cf. 3:9). Humble in her poverty, Ruth took up her occupation as a low-ranking gleaner behind the employed harvesters (2:3). Surely, this work was not without physical and social risk (2:8–9, 21–22). As such, Ruth demonstrated courage and sacrifice in her work. Upon returning to Bethlehem with Naomi, Ruth displayed a remarkable work ethic as she gathered grain in the fields. She took on the provision of the family. One worker commented, “she came out and has continued from morning until now, except that she rested a short time” (2:7). Ruth also embraced an obedient lifestyle. Later in the story, Ruth said to Naomi, “I will do everything you say” (3:5). All of these characteristics would later be summarized in Boaz's statement about Ruth’s character: “all my fellow townspeople know that you are a woman of noble character” (3:11).

Ruth’s virtuous character and righteous conduct in serving Naomi are a clear reflection of her broader godliness. In fact, in this short narrative, Ruth fulfilled most (if not all) of the Ten Commandments. She left the gods of Moab to make Yahweh her God (1:15–17) (Commandment 1–2). She took a vow in the Lord’s name and pledged to live faithfully to her vow (1:17) (Commandment 3). She navigated work and rest with godly balance (2:7; cf. 1:9; 3:1) (Commandment 4). She honored Naomi, her only remaining parent (and mother-in-law nonetheless), by working in the fields to provide for her (2:1–13; cf. notice the reference to Ruth as daughter: 1:6, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, 22; 2:2, 8, 20, 22; 3:1, 10, 11, 16, 18; 4:15). Ruth also showed respect to others in authority (2:7) (Commandment 5). The sanctity of life is showcased by Ruth bearing a child (4:13–21) and Boaz commanding Ruth’s protection (2:8–10, 22) (Commandment 6). Ruth remained sexually pure and faithful (3:1–18; 4:13) (Commandment 7). She did not take from the field what was not hers but followed the gleaning rules (2:1–23) (Commandment 8). She sought after the truth (3:12–13) (Commandment 9). She was content with much (2:14–18) or little (2:7, 13) (Commandment 10). In her conduct and character, Ruth was a “worthy woman” (3:11)—a model of covenant commitment and godly living.

_Gracious Provision_. Ruth encountered gracious provision as she lived a faithful life. In particular, Ruth received gracious provision from Boaz (2:10, 13; cf. 2:2), an agent of God’s care for his faithful follower. A godly benefactor—“a prominent man of noble character” (2:1; cf. 2:4; 4:11)—Boaz was a source of divine favor. This God-fearing patron instructed Ruth to glean with the community of servant girls (2:8). He secured her protection through his authoritative order (2:9). Further, he arranged for Ruth’s nourishment during her gleaning work: both drink (2:9) and food (2:14). More than mere material supply, Boaz honored this woman who was beset with shame and disgrace (2:9, 14), guarding her from further insult and rebuke (2:15–16). The provision Ruth received was both sufficient (2:14) and abundant (2:16, 18). Boaz made some of her gleaning work easier (2:16), and Ruth brought leftovers from her meal home to give to Naomi (2:18).

Ruth and Naomi experienced a complete reversal of their life situation. A life of hardship became a life of rest (1:9; 3:1; cp. 2:7; 3:18). Boaz’s kindness brought comfort to a family filled with grief and pain (2:13). Previously empty and vulnerable, this Israelite-Moabite duo was satisfied (2:14, 18) and secured (2:14, 18). A household riddled with shame was now protected from reproach (2:15), rebuke (2:16), and assault (2:22). A widowed woman prone to be forgotten was “noticed” (2:19; cf. 2:10) by Boaz. Ultimately, Boaz himself was a channel of God’s provision for Ruth (and Naomi): “may you receive a rich reward from the Lord, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have taken refuge” (2:12; cp. 3:9).

Faithful devotion to God places us in a position to receive God’s kind and merciful care. As faith in God amounts to an empty-handed plea for God’s help, our total trust in God assigns our well-being over to God’s jurisdiction. Entrusting ourselves to God’s safekeeping, we rest confidently that God will meet all of our needs. Often God’s favor shows up in surprising ways, further encouraging our faithful commitment to God and his ways. The Christian life is not based upon earned or merited favor. That is, Christians do not gain God’s favor by good behavior. Instead, we receive God’s gifts with open hands and sincere hearts. A life of humble trust that is devoted to serving God in all circumstances and a bold faith that is willing to risk one’s own welfare in following God are both apt descriptions of Ruth’s faithful devotion and a godly life that characterizes all faithful followers of Christ.

##### There Is a Redeemer: Entering into God’s Gracious Redemption

###### Biblical Narrative (Ruth 3:1–18)

Ruth’s success in Boaz’s field was a clear sign that God had shown his favor to these two women. Seeing this divinely provided opportunity, Naomi devised a plan to seek “a resting place” for Ruth so that “it may be well with [her]” (3:1). In essence, Naomi wanted to ensure longer-term security for the family through Ruth’s marriage to Boaz (3:2). One night, Naomi instructed Ruth to wash and anoint herself, put on a cloak, and go to the threshing floor where Boaz would be sleeping (3:3). Naomi instructed Ruth to go in stealth, not approaching Boaz until he finished eating and drinking (3:3). After finding out where he laid, Ruth was supposed to uncover his feet, lay down, and wait for his instructions (3:4). In her exemplary obedience, Ruth agreed to the plan (3:5) and “did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do” (3:6–7).

As Ruth uncovered Boaz’s feet and lay down in secret, Boaz was initially unaware that Ruth had come (3:7). Consequently, Boaz was startled when he woke up and saw a woman lying at his feet (3:8). Ruth identified herself and asked for Boaz to become her redeemer: to take her in marriage and provide ongoing security for her and her family. Specifically, Ruth made this request of Boaz: “Spread the corner of your garment over me, for you are a kinsman-redeemer” (3:9). Boaz responded by blessing Ruth for not chasing after younger men (3:10). Since the people of the town knew that Ruth was a “woman of noble character” and Boaz had taken notice of her along the way, he agreed to marry her (3:11).

There was, of course, one challenge: there was a redeemer, a family relative, who was closer than Boaz. This man had the first right to marry Ruth (3:12–13). Boaz told Ruth that in the morning he would speak with the other kinsman-redeemer, and he would redeem her if the other refused to do so (3:13). Following Boaz’s instructions, Ruth stayed until morning and left early so that no one would know that she had come (3:13–15). Ruth eventually returned to Naomi to bring her the good news (and a hefty load of grain) (3:16–17). Hopeful and expectant, the only thing for Ruth and Naomi to do was to wait to see what would occur (3:18).

###### Biblical Principles

_Plan of Redemption_. According to Naomi’s plan (3:1–4), Ruth approached Boaz to request his coverage as their kinsman-redeemer (3:9). Boaz marrying Ruth would secure the well-being of the family, transforming their condition of poverty, grief, and loss into a situation of provision, joy, and blessing. This is seen in Ruth’s bold request for Boaz to “spread the corner of [his] garment over [her]” (3:9). Although Ruth would become the recipient of Boaz’s loving protection, Ruth herself had “shown more kindness now than before” (3:10) in her specific marriage request of Boaz. Trusting in Boaz as her divinely appointed kinsman-redeemer, Ruth demonstrated humble submission (3:9), genuine faith (3:9), duty-bound respect (3:14), and steadfast patience (3:18). Placing herself at the mercy of Boaz, Ruth entrusted herself to Boaz’s safekeeping. Boaz expressed his commitment to Ruth’s redemption (3:13), showing that he would “not rest unless he has resolved the matter today” (3:18; cf. 1:9; 2:7; 3:1).

God has a plan of redemption for his people. He invites people to receive this redemption in an act of self-denying faith: entrusting oneself wholly to God’s redemptive care. Like Ruth in this narrative, redemption is only received by placing ourselves under God’s coverage. An act of genuine faith is an act of humble trust, submission, and patient hope in God’s work. Salvation is a work that must be done for us and not one that we can accomplish on our own. It is truly a work of God’s grace, received by those who place themselves under God’s care. God promises that he will complete this work on our behalf, bringing us real and lasting rest from our sin, pain, and travail. In this way, those who place their faith in God put themselves in the path of God’s divine blessing.

_The Blessing of Redemption_. As kinsman-redeemer, Boaz secured Ruth’s well-being. He was the source of “a resting place” (3:1) for Ruth. Finding coverage under Boaz’s protection would cause things to “be well” (3:1) with Ruth, showering upon her the blessing of divine favor (3:10). Within the provision of God’s redemption and blessing, there was no fear (3:11) and abundant supply of God’s good gifts (3:11, 15; cf. 3:17). When one considered “all that Boaz had done for her” (3:16), it was clear that the woman who had experienced great loss in her bereavement was no longer “empty-handed” (3:17) in her newfound relationship with the kinsman-redeemer. When God’s plan of redemption comes to fruition, loss is turned into gain, grief is turned into joy, and fear is turned into security. The transformation of Ruth’s earthly situation in her marriage to Boaz is a subtle and substantive reflection of the greater transformation that occurs when disciples place themselves under the coverage of God’s redemption in Jesus Christ.

_The Devotion of the Redeemed_. In the context of God’s unfolding plan of redemption, we see (once again) Ruth’s godly life. After Naomi instructed Ruth how to approach Boaz, this faithful servant “did everything her mother-in-law had instructed her to do” (3:6; cf. 3:5). Ruth was a person who demonstrated respectability (3:3) and discretion (3:4, 7, 14). Boaz himself recognized that Ruth was “a woman of noble character” (3:11), who had “shown more kindness now than before” (3:10) by displaying exclusive devotion to Boaz. This exclusive faith commitment was expressed in her phrase: “I am your servant Ruth” (3:9). The reputation of Ruth’s godly character was something which “all [Boaz’s] fellow townspeople [knew]” (3:11). God’s faithfulness to Ruth and Naomi (1:8; 2:20) enabled Ruth to exercise her faithfulness to God’s commands (3:10). The exclusive faith, complete submission, and godly character of Ruth are once again brief depictions of what faithful devotion to God entails. Such genuine devotion is a sincere response to God’s open invitation to gracious redemption.

##### Rescue And Redemption: First Things First

###### Biblical Narrative (Ruth 4:1–22)

According to his word, Boaz went the next morning to the gate of the city to take care of the matter related to redeeming Ruth (4:1). He gathered together ten elders of the city and the redeemer who had first rights (4:1–2). Boaz told him that Naomi’s field was available to purchase (4:3–4). Boaz told him, “If you want to redeem it, do so. But if you will not redeem it, tell me so I may know, because there is no one but you to redeem it, and I am next after you” (4:4).

At first, the redeemer agreed to purchase the land, saying, “I will redeem it” (4:4). Nevertheless, when Boaz told him the purchase of the land also required him to marry Ruth (4:5), he declined the offer. Specifically, the first kinsman-redeemer said that if he redeemed the land and Ruth he would “jeopardize [his] own inheritance” (4:6). Consequently, he told Boaz, “Take my right of redemption, because I cannot redeem it” (4:6). Surrendering the right of redemption to Boaz, the other relative took off his sandal and handed it to Boaz as a sign that he was giving his redemption rights to Boaz (4:7–8). This symbolic act was a “confirmation in Israel” that made such a transaction “legally binding” (4:7; cf. 4:8). With the deal sealed, Boaz announced that the elders and people were witnesses that he was redeeming Elimelech’s possessions and family (4:9–11). In so doing, Boaz committed to “raise up the name of the deceased through his inheritance, so that his name will not disappear from among his brothers or from the gate of his home” (4:10). The elders and people affirmed the transaction and they pronounced a blessing upon the household of Ruth and Boaz (4:11–12).

True to his word, Boaz married Ruth (4:13). Showing his grace and favor upon Ruth and Naomi, “the Lord enabled [Ruth] to conceive, and she gave birth to a son” (4:13). Ruth’s child, Obed, would be the grandfather of David, the great king of Israel (4:13, 17, 18–22). Importantly, this child would form the lineage from which the ultimate Redeemer, Jesus Christ, would be born. A life of tragedy and turmoil had been dramatically reversed: not primarily by the faithful obedience of Ruth, but by the gracious rescue of a faithful redeemer. Naomi, who began the story lamenting her life, now offered a word of worship and praise: “Blessed be the Lord, who has not left you this day without a kinsman-redeemer” (4:14). Women were once astonished at Naomi’s bitter tragedy (cf. 1:19–22). Now, women were celebrating Naomi’s new beginnings, beginnings made possible by a redeemer: “He will renew your life and sustain you in your old age” (4:14). The woman who lost all her children, now “took [Ruth’s] child, placed him on her lap, and became a nurse to him” (4:16).

###### Biblical Principles

_Act of Redemption_. The climax of this narrative recounts Boaz acting as kinsman-redeemer. Acting shrewdly and honestly, Boaz assumed responsibility for Ruth’s redemption, a duty the other relative was unable (really, unwilling) to own (4:3–6). He publicly confirmed this redemption before the local leaders and the people (4:1–2, 7–8, 9–11). This redemption came at a price, purchasing the land and assuming ongoing care for Ruth and Naomi (4:3, 6, 8). Willing to absorb this cost, Boaz voluntarily agreed to act as kinsman-redeemer (4:9–10). The act of redemption resulted in the birth of a child (4:13, 16–17), which secured the blessing of the family and the generations to come (4:11–12, 14–15). Upon this act of redemption, Ruth was blessed (4:11), Boaz was honored (4:11–12), God was praised (4:14), and the child was announced as a famous restorer of life (4:14–15).

By the end of the story, famine, widowhood, shame, and childlessness are all resolved. And while Ruth’s exemplary obedience is part of the remedy (2:12–13), it is not the full picture. While Ruth and Naomi have received temporary protection in Boaz’s generosity, they lack ongoing security until Ruth is redeemed in marriage. The final scene of this story chronicles redemption that is credited to God, the only fitting foundation for a life of redemption, faith, and obedience. Obedience alone cannot bring about the transformation that we hope for. Only a redeemer can rescue us from the bondage of slavery to a life of freedom. God’s divine redemption is the only way to heal our deep wounds of pain, grief, and sorrow. God’s sovereignly-provided redeemer is the only one who can transform tragedy to triumph, disquiet to rest, and death to life. Only divine redemption can make the life of obedience possible. Once we experience God’s redemption—the restoration of our life (4:15)—obedience becomes God’s path to the best possible life. In short, God’s gracious work of salvation and rescue is the necessary prerequisite, the only viable context, for a life of obedience. While this story highlights God’s divine redemption (for Ruth and Naomi), the same story anticipated God’s ultimate redemption (for all humanity) in the person of Christ.

_Jesus Christ_. Ruth’s story foreshadows the coming of Christ. Boaz’s role as kinsman-redeemer is a meaningful (but meager) shadow of the ultimate redemption that God provided in Jesus. At one level, Boaz’s earlier statement, “there is a redeemer nearer than I” (3:12), is a reference to the other relative who had the right to marry Ruth (4:4). At a deeper level, this statement forecasts the superior redemption that Jesus himself provides, not only restoring a grieving widow from her bereavement but also saving sinful people from eternal condemnation. Nevertheless, this story not only prefigures the coming of Christ, but it also records the lineage from which Christ will be born into the world. The marriage of Boaz and Ruth, a divinely orchestrated union, resulted in the birth of a child named Obed (4:13, 16). Amazingly, Obed “became the father of Jesse, the father of David” (4:17; cf. 4:18–22). This line of David is the precise ancestry from which Jesus was born into the world. The life of godliness is grounded in the redemption of Christ. Greater than Boaz, Jesus is the restorer of fortunes, the rescuer for sinners, and the savior of the world. The ending of Ruth’s narrative is the beginning and foundation of the life of discipleship. Emphatically, the path to the best possible life—the life of blessing—begins where Ruth’s story concludes, receiving redemption in Christ. Said of Ruth’s child, the statement is even more true of Jesus himself: “May his name become famous in Israel” (4:14) and beyond because Jesus will “renew your life and sustain you” (4:15).

##### Conclusion

Ruth’s narrative began with incredible loss. Naomi and Ruth endured affliction, social instability, displacement, death, grief, and hopelessness. Amid this grievous hardship, Ruth displayed a simple yet sincere faith. She refused the comforts of her home and traveled back to Bethlehem with her widowed mother-in-law. Upon arriving in Judah, her courageous and determined faith caused her to provide for Naomi by gleaning in the fields. In God’s divine providence, she gleaned in the field of Boaz, a kinsman-redeemer who showed Ruth great favor. Eventually, Boaz agreed to marry Ruth and provide protection for the whole bereaved family. When he redeemed Ruth by marrying her, the situation of the family dramatically changed, even placing Ruth in the lineage of God’s ultimate Redeemer, Jesus Christ. A powerful story of redemption, faith, and obedience, Ruth showcases what a life of godly devotion entails.

Although she lived generations ago, Ruth’s journey resonates with our own. Quite easily, we can relate to her suffering and sorrow. Loss and tragedy are all too familiar in this earthly existence. The blessing and favor Ruth eventually enjoyed touch upon our own longings for the good life. The godly lifestyle of this virtuous woman summons us to find a fulfilling and satisfying life by faith in and obedience to Christ. A life marked by surprising reversals of fortune, Ruth's experience of divine grace is of great appeal. We, too, can empathize with her needy condition and relate to her desire for divine favor. What the poor migrant widow needed most—what made her life a true model of godliness—was redemption, rescue, and restoration. In God’s faithfulness, Ruth found—and we also find—a life of faithfulness to God.

Migrants in the region of Moab, Ruth and her mother-in-law, Naomi, experienced painful loss and great suffering. They endured the hardship of a severe famine, the death of beloved family members, and the shame of poverty and marginalization. Ruth displayed incredible faith in God, obedient conduct, and godliness of character in the midst of this affliction. God provided for Ruth and Naomi as they came under the protection of their kinsman-redeemer, Boaz. He provided for their needs and eventually married Ruth. The widows’ suffering turned into blessing as they found coverage and safety in this redemption. Ruth gave birth to a child who would form the lineage of Jesus Christ. The narrative highlights God’s gracious redemption and the importance of faithful obedience to God during difficult circumstances. A summary of this story’s principles is outlined below. |

Loving devotion to God results in loving care for others (1:8–10, 14, 16).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Like Ruth, faithful followers of Christ believe in God (1:8–9, 16), entrust themselves to God (1:8–10), commit sacrificially to God (1:16), hope in God’s good promises (1:9), and live accountably before God by obeying his commands (1:17). Genuine devotion to God is an undivided faith and obedience that is described as loving devotion (1:8; 2:20; 3:10). |
| **Obedience and Godly Living**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Ruth was faithful to God and Naomi. Her life is an exemplar of faith and godly living. Her life was characterized by faithfulness (1:14, 16–17; 3:10, 12), service (2:2–7, 11–12, 17, 23; 3:9), love (1:8; 3:10; 4:15), obedience (3:5–6), honor (3:3, 7), humility (2:10; 3:9), discretion (3:4, 7, 14), and virtue (3:11; 4:11). Her life of faith resulted in a life of godly conduct.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Jesus is the better redeemer than Boaz (3:12) and the one who has the right, power, and willingness to redeem sinful humans (4:4). In his act of redemption, Jesus was willing (4:9–10), effective (4:1–2, 7–8, 9–11), sacrificial (4:3, 6, 8–10), and transformative (4:3, 6, 8), God-glorifying (4:14), and life-giving (4:14–15). Ruth’s child forms the lineage of the birthline of Jesus (4:13, 16–22). Jesus’ redemption will be broadly announced (4:14), and he will bring his people life and rest (4:15).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Spiritual Practice

Reflect on the following summary of core spiritual practices. Consider which spiritual practice you will perform in order to internalize this biblical passage. If you need a guide, consider working through the scripted spiritual practice on the next page as a way to internalize the truth of the story.

**Reflective Walk**
_In the following exercise, take the opportunity to put into practice insights from Ruth’s story. As walking was a common activity in Ruth’s day (and her own journey), use the walking exercise explained on the following page as a means to reflect on your own faith journey. With any journey, it is important to evaluate where you have been, where you are, and where you are going. Discerning what path we are on is truly a matter of life and death. What path are you on?_

This week, carve out some time (30–45 minutes) to be alone and go on a walk or a hike. Try not to rush this moment. Give yourself enough time to honestly reflect on what path your life has taken.

Before you go on your walk, pray the following prayer from Psalm 143:8 to focus your time of walking and reflection:

> “Let me hear in the morning of your steadfast love, for in you I trust. Make me know the way I should go, for to you I lift up my soul.”

During your walk, take time to reflect on what “way of life” you are living. Particularly, compare and contrast your life to that of Ruth’s. As you walk, here are some helpful questions to consider (take your time to reflect on what you believe God wants you to focus on, and don’t feel the pressure to answer all of them):
Am I on God’s path or another path?
What unexpected turns has God taken me on?
Is the way I’m living leading toward life or death?
What kind of life do I really want to live?
In what areas of my life have I gotten off God’s path?
What are the things God is calling me to obey?

As you come to the end of your walk, offer this simple prayer to the Lord from Psalm 143:10:

> “Teach me to do your will, for you are my God!”
